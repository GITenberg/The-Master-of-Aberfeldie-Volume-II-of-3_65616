THE MASTER OF ABERFELDIE.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
MYSTERY.
</h3>

<p>
So all the guests had quitted Dundargue
now but Hawke Holcroft.  In two days
he was to depart for what he called 'his
chambers in town;' thus Allan was
compelled to continue his polite dissimulation,
and be on suave and apparently easy terms
with him as a guest, though the latter felt
that there was an undefinable change in
his manner towards him.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, it was only by a great effort of
self-control that the Master of Aberfeldie,
a man with the highest and keenest sense
of honour, and knowing all he did,
continued to treat Holcroft with politeness;
but he writhed and shivered when he
heard him, in the drawing-room or
elsewhere, address Olive or Eveline.
</p>

<p>
All the forenoon after Cameron's
departure, when poor little Eveline was most
triste and miserable, our other pair of
lovers were very happy.  They had what
they were pleased to call 'a picnic' on the
tower-head of Dundargue.  Allan's portion
thereof was cigars, and Olive's a little
basket of purple grapes and luscious
strawberries (though the season was
autumn) from the hothouses.
</p>

<p>
So with these two, the hours passed
sweetly and swiftly, with the blue sky
overhead, while far away in the distance,
and steeped in sunny haze, stretched the
lovely Carse of Gowrie; and talking of
themselves, their past folly, their present
joy, and the brilliant future that was to
come, they billed and cooed after the
fashion of all lovers since flowers grew in
Eden.
</p>

<p>
Allan lolled at length on the stone
bartizan of the tower whence molten lead
and arrows had more than once been
launched on a foe beneath, Olive with her
fair head reclined against his shoulder
toying with her fruit, while he did so with
her silky hair, or kissed her lips and hands,
and called her all manner of funny and
endearing names that would look rather odd
in print; and yet amid their present
happiness it was strange that each wondered
more than once, if coldness or estrangement
would ever come between them
again.
</p>

<p>
Never&mdash;oh, never.
</p>

<p>
'You complained that the gardeners saw
me kissing you in the rosery yesterday,
Olive,' said Allan.  'Now, little woman,
who should I kiss if I don't kiss you?
Well, only the crows overhead can see us
up here, at all events.'
</p>

<p>
But now as he toyed with her hands,
marvelling as he did so at their whiteness
and beauty, and anon played with the
bangles that encircled her rounded arms,
he bethought of the one worn&mdash;yes,
actually worn&mdash;by Holcroft, and silently he
resolved to possess himself of it without
delay; so, ere the bell rang for luncheon,
he made an excuse, conducted his cousin,
with many a pause and long delay which
were not idly spent, down the dark and
winding staircase from the head of the
tower.
</p>

<p>
In his new-found happiness until now
he had forgotten all about the bangle,
which&mdash;perhaps for some ulterior purpose
of his own&mdash;Holcroft seemed to have
quietly appropriated, and by whom he
wished it returned without any fuss or
explanation.
</p>

<p>
To this end he sought that personage
after luncheon was over, and was sure he
would find him either practising strokes in
the billiard-room, in the smoking-room, or
stables, watching the horses and catching
hints from the grooms.
</p>

<p>
He found him in the first-named place,
cue in hand.
</p>

<p>
'Ready for a game?' said he.
</p>

<p>
'No, thanks.'
</p>

<p>
'Sorry; Cameron, and everyone is gone.
I'm reduced to playing the right hand
against the left.'
</p>

<p>
'And while playing I perceive that you
have a gold bangle of Miss Raymond's on
your left wrist?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' replied Holcroft, leisurely&mdash;Allan
thought impertinently.
</p>

<p>
'Did she give it to you?'
</p>

<p>
'Why do you ask?'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Did</i> she give it to you?' repeated
Allan, with a dangerous gleam in his dark
eyes.
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'How comes it to be there, then?'
</p>

<p>
'Don't take to high falutin.  I slipped
it on in mere fun, and it will not come off
again.
</p>

<p>
'Indeed! allow me.'
</p>

<p>
And Allan, in a moment, by twisting
the ductile Indian gold, wrenched it off,
and Holcroft's eyes had a malevolent flash
in them as he stooped to strike a ball.
</p>

<p>
'Thanks,' said Allan, pocketing the
bangle.  'Now we shall have a cigar.'
</p>

<p>
For a moment he felt a little ashamed of
his sudden irritation, and proffered his
cigar-case to Holcroft, who smiled his
thanks and accepted a Havana.
</p>

<p>
The Master was younger and handsomer
than he; the heir to an ancient title and
estate; he had the envied prestige of
having borne himself bravely when under fire
with the Black Watch, and had a goodly
crop of medals&mdash;not so many as my Lord
Wolseley, of course&mdash;but still, when in
uniform, a goodly display.
</p>

<p>
He had all the advantages over Hawke
Holcroft that one man could have over
another; and in his heart of hearts the
other hated&mdash;yea, with a bitter and deadly
hate&mdash;Allan Graham&mdash;a hate beyond his
love, real or supposed, for Olive Raymond,
natheless all Olive's beauty and her
money&mdash;his chief lure and incentive.
</p>

<p>
While conversing and joking together in
the smoking-room, or on the terrace, amid
the pleasures of the table, knocking the
balls about at billiards or so forth, how
little could the unconscious Allan have
dreamed that his father's guest&mdash;the son
of his old friend&mdash;had been pondering over
the art of 'Killing no murder;' of accidents
brought about in the hunting-field, at cover
shooting, or hill-climbing; even of
dynamite cigars!  Had he not heard of such
things at Monaco, Homburg, and elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
He knew that there was quite a manufactory
of such cigars at Temeswar, in
Austria; but wherever were such pleasant
gifts 'to be obtained in an out-of-the-way
hole like the Carse of Gowrie?'
</p>

<p>
His teeth under his moustache glittered
or glistened whitely when such ideas
occurred to him; though he chatted away
with perhaps forced <i>insouciance</i> and
gaiety, under all his assumed ease of
manner there smouldered a lava-like
glow&mdash;mingled hate of Allan and coveting of
Olive, but with an emotion of a much
coarser nature, combined with greed.
</p>

<p>
Seeing Clairette, Olive's maid, passing,
Allan made up the bangle in a little packet
as he still wished no more explanations on
the subject, and desired her to give it to
her mistress.
</p>

<p>
'You and Miss Raymond seem exceedingly
good friends now,' said Holcroft.
</p>

<p>
'We were never otherwise,' replied
Allan, curtly, and displeased by the remark.
</p>

<p>
'What a prize in matrimony such a girl
must be, with so much beauty and&mdash;wealth.'
</p>

<p>
'It is sometimes a misfortune for a girl
to be rich, or to be thought so,' said
Allan.
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because she may become the prey of
some needy fortune-hunter or enterprising
scamp.'
</p>

<p>
Holcroft winced at the reply, though it
was made casually and without the least
design by Allan.
</p>

<p>
'But in marrying, Miss Raymond might
perhaps be poor enough.'
</p>

<p>
'What paradox is this?' asked Holcroft,
thoroughly interested, while Allan felt
some disdain at discussing such matters
with such a man.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, poor as a church mouse, unless&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Unless what?'
</p>

<p>
'She marries <i>me</i>,' replied Allan, who,
with perhaps pardonable pique, only
thought of provoking a man who had
tried to rival him, and whom he deemed
a needy and adventurous gambler.
</p>

<p>
This seemed only to corroborate what
Holcroft had heard before, and gave him
some occasion for thought.
</p>

<p>
'I have heard rumours of a family
compact&mdash;a most fortunate one for you,' said
he, smiling; 'but suppose you&mdash;excuse
me for saying so&mdash;were to predecease
her?'
</p>

<p>
'Then my pretty cousin would be a free
woman; but I don't mean to die yet awhile.
Let us take a turn before dinner,' he
added, to change the conversation he had no
desire to continue.
</p>

<p>
'Where?'
</p>

<p>
'Anywhere you like; but, as the
evening has become chill, suppose we
smoke our cigars in the picture-gallery?'
</p>

<p>
'All right, I am your man.'
</p>

<p>
Had Allan looked at Hawke Holcroft
just then he might have perceived a
lurid gleam in his stealthy eyes, and
how his hands were clenched till the
nails of his fingers bruised the palms
thereof.
</p>

<p>
Olive received her bangle, and though
startled by the abruptness with which it
was returned, without message or explanation
from Allan, as Clairette told her, she
thought less of the circumstance then than
she did a day or two after.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Dinner was announced; Holcroft appeared
in accurate evening dress as usual,
and, after waiting a few minutes for Allan
who did not appear, the meal was proceeded
with in the slow fashion peculiar to
Dundargue, though only five were seated
at table.
</p>

<p>
Ere dessert came, Lady Aberfeldie dispatched
a servant to Allan's room in search
of him.  He was not there, though his
evening dress was laid out as usual.
</p>

<p>
'Where can he be?  Where can he
have gone?' were the queries on all hands,
which, as night began to draw on without
his appearing, took the form of alarm,
'and what can have happened?'
</p>

<p>
'Did Allan drop hints of going
anywhere?' asked Lord Aberfeldie.
</p>

<p>
All answered 'No.'
</p>

<p>
'It is most mysterious.'
</p>

<p>
Still more mysterious did it appear when
the night, passed without his being seen,
and when his place was still vacant at the
breakfast-table next day.  Lord Aberfeldie
was in dire perplexity; the ladies were pale
and already betook themselves to tears.
</p>

<p>
'If Allan has left the house as suddenly
as he did before, he has taken neither
clothes nor portmanteau with him, as
Tappleton assures me; so what can it mean?'
exclaimed Lord Aberfeldie.
</p>

<p>
A gun was missing from the gun-room.
Could Allan have gone to shoot with
Logan at Loganlee?  But Olive deemed it
impossible that he would do so
without consulting her, and on looking at
Holcroft she thought he looked rather hot and
disturbed.
</p>

<p>
'The bangle, the bangle!' thought the
girl, with sudden terror.  'Can he have
gone in a fit of jealousy.  Mercy! if it
should be so.'
</p>

<p>
Inquiries proved that Allan had not
passed out by the entrance gates, as the
lodge-keeper affirmed, and no trace of
footsteps could be found at any of the
private gates to the grounds; and it
was soon discovered that he had not
taken a ticket for any place at the railway
station.
</p>

<p>
What terrible mystery was here?
</p>

<p>
The family began to look with growing
alarm and dismay blankly into each other's
pale faces.
</p>

<p>
Keepers and gillies, strong, active, and
keen-sighted fellows, Hector, Alister Bain,
Angus and Dugal Glas&mdash;even old Ronald
Gair, the piper&mdash;searched, but in vain, the
grounds, plantations, even the adjacent
hills and glens; but not a trace was found
of the missing Allan.
</p>

<p>
He seemed suddenly to have dropped
out of existence.
</p>

<p>
As this, his last day at Dundargue, drew
on, none made himself more active in
searching and riding about the roads than
Holcroft, and so preoccupied were all that
no one&mdash;even Olive&mdash;noticed that his face
was pale and cadaverous&mdash;and wore a very
disturbed expression, and that his pale
eyes seemed to glare defiantly if anyone
looked at him, while he sedulously kept his
<i>right hand gloved</i>.
</p>

<p>
How are we to relate all that really had
happened.

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
A MODERN USE FOR A MEDI√ÜVAL INSTITUTION.
</h3>

<p>
'The world is not a bad world, after all,'
said Allan, as he and Holcroft, after a
casual glance at the long lines of portraits
panelled in the wainscotting of the gallery,
together with many a Cuyp, Zucchero,
Canaletti, and so forth, now looked out
from one of the lofty windows upon the
fair domain of his family, that spread for
miles around Dundargue.
</p>

<p>
'It is easy enough for you to talk thus
of the world,' thought Holcroft, 'but if,
like me, you had only debts and difficulties
for your patrimony you might take a
different view.'
</p>

<p>
'I was born here in Dundargue, and
all the happy memories of my childhood
centre round it,' said Allan.  'Every man,
woman, and child in the place are known
to me; every rock and hill, glen and
woodland, familiar, with all their stories
and traditions; and wherever I might be
with the Black Watch, in England on the
staff, far away in central India, or in the
gorges of Afghanistan, my memory always
fled home to dear old Dundargue and all
its surroundings.'
</p>

<p>
'How pathetic!' sneered Holcroft, silently,
and puzzled to understand the mood of
Allan, who, in the consciousness of his own
happiness with Olive, felt at that moment
rather inclined to take a soft and generous
view of the world at large.
</p>

<p>
'It certainly is a fine old ancestral
house&mdash;one to be proud of,' said Holcroft, aloud,
'with a special history, and all that sort
of thing.  I have heard a devil of a deal
about its oubliette&mdash;where is it?'
</p>

<p>
'Let me show you&mdash;come this way,' said
Allan, lighting a fresh cigar.
</p>

<p>
Smoking together, Allan, and Holcroft
following, wandered up and down circular
stone stairs in narrow turrets, where the
steps had been worn and hollowed by the
feet of long departed generations; through
dusky corridors where, in some places,
moth-eaten arras hung upon its rusty
tenter-hooks, and where, as Holcroft said,
there was 'a loud smell of mice;' through
secret doors and past 'the priest's hole,' in
which James of Jerusalem abode, till they
reached a narrow stone passage near the
summit of the great tower, closed by a
massive little door.
</p>

<p>
Allan threw this open, and the black,
round mouth of the oubliette, about four
feet in diameter, yawned before them.
</p>

<p>
The great, horizontal stone slab or
flagstone, which in ancient times had closed
the mouth of this horrible accessory to
feudal tyranny, had long since given place
to a massive trap-door of oak, which was
held up by a wooden prop, under which
the cold, dark vault showed its mysterious
profundity.
</p>

<p>
'By Jove! it is a strange affair; more
like a draw-well than anything else.'
</p>

<p>
'But supposed to be twelve feet diameter
at the bottom&mdash;a fine old relic of the
days when "warriors bold wore spurs of
gold," and the rack and the red-hot
ploughshare were aids to the orthodox opinions
of society in religion and politics.'
</p>

<p>
And Allan laughed as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
'How foetid its atmosphere is!  That
door has not been open for an age, and
may be closed for as long again.  No one
ever comes here.'
</p>

<p>
Peering downward, as if into a well, they
saw the outlines of their heads reflected in
a little pool of water at the bottom, but
how far down it was impossible to say.
</p>

<p>
'Once upon a time,' said Allan, 'when
parts of the Carse of Gowrie were under
water, in wet seasons especially, it flowed
in here, how no one knew, unless through
fissures in the rock, and drowned like a
rat any luckless wight who was thrown in
to be&mdash;to be&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What?'
</p>

<p>
'Forgotten.  So the phrase went then;
hence its name.'
</p>

<p>
'And do you mean to say that no one
who was dropped into that confounded
hole ever came up again?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Were their cries not heard?'
</p>

<p>
'No; the walls around are so thick, and
the bottom is in the living rock on which
Dundargue stands.'
</p>

<p>
'By Jove!' exclaimed Holcroft again, as
if perplexed, so much so that he had let
his cigar grow cold.  'And their bones?' he
asked, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
'Were found in quantities by certain
explorers, who went down with torches,
some years ago.  I have not looked into
this place for years&mdash;not since I left for
the regiment in India,' said Allan, stooping,
somewhat dangerously&mdash;and, to Holcroft's
sudden idea, somewhat temptingly&mdash;over
the dangerous profundity, into
which he was striving to peer.
</p>

<p>
With all the rapidity of light, many
terrible thoughts now crowded into the
mind of Holcroft.  He hated Allan
Graham with deadly rivalry and hate
combined.  Never again, in the desperation of
his affairs, might he have the chance of an
introduction to such a prize as Olive
Raymond, or be on such a footing, as he had
recently found himself with her.
</p>

<p>
He loathed Allan for all Allan possessed,
and, as we are told, 'a coward who knows
himself to be at once despised but
unchastised, for a woman's sake, can hate.'
</p>

<p>
If he lost his chances with Olive,
beggary stared him in the face; drops of
perspiration started to his forehead, and
chance now confirmed his diabolical
resolution.  The gloomy fiend was uppermost,
his revenge, and perhaps future triumph,
stood embodied before him.  He did not
pause, and all these dire thoughts occurred
to him in less than the space of one
vibration of a pendulum.
</p>

<p>
Had the Master of Aberfeldie turned
sharply round he might have read in
Holcroft's white face an expression that was
not pleasant to look upon just then&mdash;the
face of one that would work him mischief
if he could; but the unwitting Allan was
doing what he had not done since boyhood,
he was peering with vague curiosity into
the profundity below.
</p>

<p>
A fury, a clamorous anxiety, seemed to
blaze up in the heart and brain of
Holcroft, who was a practised 'bruiser,' and
he suddenly gave Allan an awful blow
under the left ear&mdash;a blow hit right out from
the shoulder&mdash;that shot him headlong into
the vault.
</p>

<p>
He vanished from the light; there was
a heavy thud far down below, and then all
became still&mdash;unnaturally so; but Holcroft
could hear the beating of his own pulses,
while the blood seemed to be surging about
his throbbing temples.
</p>

<p>
Was he acting in a dream from which
he would waken to find himself in bed? or
was all this happening, not to him, but to
some one else?  No, there was the bruised
right hand, from which the violence of
his blow had torn the skin.
</p>

<p>
He had read of dark crimes, of <i>murders</i>,
but little did he think he would ever
become the participator in such a deed; but
opportunity is always the devil's game.
</p>

<p>
For a minute&mdash;an eternity it seemed, by
the chaos of his mind, the sudden
inversion of all thought&mdash;he did not breathe,
he scarcely seemed to live.
</p>

<p>
There was a whisper of 'murder' on his
lips, and it seemed to have an echo, that
terrible whisper, but whether from the
walls, the trees that waved below them,
the blue sky, or the crows that were
winging their way through it, he knew not.
He seemed to whisper the awful word to
himself, with quivering lips, again and
again, as if he required an assurance of
its truth, and then sought to rouse himself
from his lethargic stupor, quit the scene
of his sudden crime, and seek safety in
flight&mdash;flight!
</p>

<p>
But, then, to quit Dundargue thus would
fix suspicion on himself.  Had not Clairette,
the French maid, seen him but lately
with Allan?  And flight would mar the
very object for which he had committed the
crime.
</p>

<p>
Should he&mdash;could he&mdash;at all risks to
himself and his fortune, ere it was too
late, strive to undo what he had done; to
give an alarm, and make some excuse or
explanation ere life had departed from the
shattered frame of his victim, or leave the
latter to his obscure fate&mdash;a grave under
his father's roof!
</p>

<p>
Cowardice and meanness, hatred, jealousy,
and avarice all suggested the latter.
</p>

<p>
He knew not the depth of this strange
prison, or how far down beneath the
foundations of lofty Dundargue and into the rock
on which it stands, the sill or floor of the
noisome vault might be.
</p>

<p>
He listened; not a sound came upward,
nor was there any, save the wild beating of
his own heart and the buzzing and singing
of blood in his ears.
</p>

<p>
He softly closed the wooden trap-door,
let the enormous iron hasp thereof drop
over the rusty staple; he closed the massive
external entrance, and stealthily crept
or glided away.
</p>

<p>
There seemed a silence all around him
now; such a silence as must have appalled
the soul of the first murderer when he
'rose up against Abel, his brother, and
slew him.'
</p>

<p>
So the tragedy&mdash;the dark crime&mdash;was
acted as suddenly as it was weird&mdash;suggested
by a whisper of the devil!  There
was nothing very tragic in the accessories
of the scene; but, as an author says, 'Are
not real tragedies, the social tragedies that
go on about us in our every-day life,
enacted like comedies, until the last
moment, when the curtain falls, and all is
dark?'
</p>

<p>
Pale as death in visage (he felt himself
to be so), stealthy in step and eye, he
stole away to his own apartment in a
modern part of the mansion.  How he
reached it he never knew, but mechanically
of course, and he blessed his stars
that he reached it unseen.
</p>

<p>
He took a long pull at the brandy
flask&mdash;tore off his collar and necktie, and
cast himself half fainting on his bed,
where he lay panting and gasping
heavily.
</p>

<p>
Every sound that came to his ear, every
step that approached, seemed to Hawke
Holcroft the herald of discovery, and he
longed with the most intense nervous
intensity to leave this loathed Dundargue
behind him!
</p>

<p>
Was the Master dying there or dead
outright?  Where he lay no sound could
ever reach the external air.  But had not
his victim assured him that no cry could
ever come from there&mdash;the place was so
deep&mdash;so remote?
</p>

<p>
Would the next evening, when he was
to depart, never come?  Then he had the
meals, the family, and their surmises to
face!
</p>

<p>
He had a haggard and hunted look that
evening and all next day, which Lord
Aberfeldie, in the kindness of his heart,
amid all his own new anxiety, attributed
to the pressure of his monetary affairs.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
HOLCROFT DEPARTS.
</h3>

<p>
It was a considerable relief to Holcroft's
mind to perceive that this second abrupt
disappearance of Allan excited more
surprise than alarm in his family circle; and
in her own thoughts Lady Aberfeldie
secretly connected it with some lovers'
quarrel between him and Olive; it was so
like their past relations that some such
folly should intervene.
</p>

<p>
The bell for dinner sounded much earlier
than usual, as Mr. Holcroft was to depart
for the south that evening, and to see him
in the drawing-room dressed <i>de rigueur</i> in
black, with spotless shirt-front and
diamond studs, with tie and collar perfect, his
hair brushed with precision and the ends
of his tawny moustache waxed out to
sharp points, who could have imagined
him an actor in that scene in the distant
arched passage, or connected him with what
was lying at the bottom of that deep, dark
oubliette!
</p>

<p>
Holcroft always thought that great
games involved serious hazards; but now
this was a hazard beyond all his previous
calculations.
</p>

<p>
The greatest chance of fortune he had
ever seen in his varied life seemed to be
slipping&mdash;or to have speedily slipped&mdash;away
from him, when Olive Raymond and
her cousin suddenly appeared on such
amicable terms; savage emotions of
mingled disappointment and revenge filled his
heart, and certainly he had given full
swing to them!
</p>

<p>
Now, what he had done was over; the
rubicon had been passed.  He was&mdash;what
he dared not name himself: the thought
of all that Allan Graham must endure ere
he died (if he was not already dead)
was&mdash;at times, but at times only&mdash;maddening
even to his destroyer; and he felt that he
could not too soon place miles upon miles
between himself and Dundargue; and that,
happen what might, he would never set
foot in Dundargue again.
</p>

<p>
Seated at that luxurious table with the
hospitable father, the patrician-like mother,
the tender sister and brilliant <i>fianc√©e</i> of him
he had slain, with stately-liveried valets in
attendance, while longing for the conveyance
or carriage that was to take him to
the station, he <i>did</i> feel more than once
as if he would go mad if it lasted
much longer&mdash;this acting&mdash;this tension of
the heart&mdash;but, as we say, for a time only.
He was too near the scene of his awful
crime not to feel his soul shrink with
selfish horror and dismay, which made him
nervously twist up, roll, and unroll his
<i>serviette</i>, as it is called in Scotland.
</p>

<p>
Was it only a few hours since he had
heard that terrible <i>thud</i> amid the darkness
and the clash of the oak trap-door?  And
there were <i>his</i> family all seated with
him&mdash;Holcroft&mdash;at the same table, all
unconscious of what was lying within a few yards
of them, and yet not considering him the
blackest criminal in the world, but a
departing guest to be treated with kindness
and courtesy.
</p>

<p>
Thank heaven he would be far away
from them ere Allan would be found to
be hopelessly gone, and he would see
nothing of their growing misery.
</p>

<p>
To drown thought, care, and memory,
Holcroft, after the ladies retired to the
drawing-room, imbibed systematically more
than usual.  Ere this, Olive had thought
his manner excited&mdash;strange only.
Unused to see men under the influence of
wine, she thought no more of it.  But, as
Holcroft took to 'lacing' his clicquot with
brandy when occasion served, that may
account for some of the peculiar remarks
to Olive yet to be recorded.
</p>

<p>
From an early period Eveline had
conceived a shuddering kind of aversion of
Holcroft&mdash;an emotion not rare in certain
nervous organisations like hers; nor could
she have explained why more particularly
<i>now</i> his presence, though at table as usual,
had filled her with an undefined distrust
and dread; yet so it was.
</p>

<p>
But in the drawing-room her own
thoughts came more than ever back to
her, and these were all of Evan Cameron.
</p>

<p>
'He is gone!' she was always whispering
to herself; 'too probably for ever and for
ever.  We shall never meet again.  How
dull my world will seem without Evan,
and how old and queer I begin to feel
already!'
</p>

<p>
But poor Eveline knew not what a small
place the world is&mdash;now-a-days especially.
</p>

<p>
'You seem rather out of sorts,' said
Lord Aberfeldie, who had been eyeing 'his
old friend's son,' while pushing the decanters
towards him; 'I hope there is nothing
wrong with you, especially as this is your
last evening here.'
</p>

<p>
'No, nothing very wrong,' stammered
Holcroft, scarcely knowing what to say,
but driven to shelter himself under what
was his normal condition; 'it is only&mdash;only&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What?'
</p>

<p>
'I have had more than one annoying
letter,' he said, with a kind of gasp, and
paused.
</p>

<p>
'About money&mdash;of course?' said Lord
Aberfeldie.
</p>

<p>
'One was a threat from a tailor,' replied
Holcroft, making a terrible effort to appear
facetious, 'who says if I don't pay him he
will take means to make me do so.'
</p>

<p>
'And you?'
</p>

<p>
'Wrote back that I was delighted to
hear he had the means, as this was more
than I had.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, my dear fellow, your father was
one of my oldest friends; for his sake can
I square it for you?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Lord Aberfeldie, don't think of
that!'
</p>

<p>
'What's the total?'' asked the other,
opening a davenport.
</p>

<p>
'Close on ¬£500,' said Holcroft, with an
effort, which certainly was an emotion, but
not gratitude.
</p>

<p>
'There, Holcroft&mdash;pay me when you
can, or choose,' said Lord Aberfeldie,
throwing down his pen, closing the
davenport, and handing a cheque for the sum
named to his guest, to stop whose thanks
he plunged at once into the inevitable story
of the charge of the Black Watch along
the Kourgan√© Hill; how he fell wounded;
and how, but for Holcroft's father, 'a squad
of infernal Russians,' <i>et cetera</i>, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
'Another glass of Mo√´t, and then we
shall join the ladies.'
</p>

<p>
'Life is a hard game with some of us
now,' said Holcroft, as he pocketed his
cheque.  'As some one has written, "Men
cannot go freebooting or looting now,
except in business; and it is quite a
question whether a modern <i>promoter</i> is not quite
as respectable a member of society as a
riever used to be, in the old days when
right was might."
</p>

<p>
'And Dundargue was built,' added Lord
Aberfeldie, laughing.
</p>

<p>
'I did not say so.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, but you thought it.'
</p>

<p>
And now they rose from the table.
</p>

<p>
Holcroft was not the better, but rather
the worse for his potations.  He had eaten
little and drunk much.  Thus he looked
very pale&mdash;almost ghastly; and a strange
fixed grimness replaced occasionally the
usual restlessness of his shifty pale eyes
and freckled face.
</p>

<p>
Curiously enough he had hovering in
his mind a kind of vengeance just then at
Olive.  But for her sudden, and, as he
thought, capricious preference for her
cousin, and throwing <i>him</i> so completely
over, the deed he had committed would
never have been done.
</p>

<p>
Eveline had withdrawn to her room,
whither her mother had followed her, bent
on worry and expostulation no doubt;
Lord Aberfeldie was required by his
steward, and Holcroft found Olive seated
alone in a bay window of the drawing-room,
watching the last rays of the sun
fading out behind the Sidlaw Hills.
</p>

<p>
'Another hour&mdash;even less, Miss
Raymond&mdash;and my place here will be vacant,'
said he, in a low and unnatural voice,
while attempting to hang over her chair in
his old fashion.
</p>

<p>
'I got back my bangle, thanks,' said she,
a little irrelevantly, but feeling a necessity
for saying something.
</p>

<p>
'Have you forgotten all that passed
between us before and after you allowed me
to retain it.'
</p>

<p>
'I never allowed you to retain it, nor
aught of mine, save perhaps a bud from
a bouquet.  I have not forgotten that
you, apparently, sought to do me a
great honour, Mr. Holcroft; but I
scarcely thought, even then, that you were
serious.'
</p>

<p>
'Serious!  Did you not know that I
loved you better than my own life.'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot listen to this kind of thing,'
said she, rising with positive hauteur and
annoyance in her face and manner; 'you
forget yourself.'
</p>

<p>
'When with you I always do&mdash;forgive me!'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot forgive you for talking to me
thus.'
</p>

<p>
'You used not to dislike me, I know;
and now there is no sacrifice I would not
make to win your love&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Permit me to pass!' exclaimed Olive,
but he barred her way, and now a glow
of half-tipsy rage seemed to possess him.
</p>

<p>
'Listen, Olive Raymond,' said he, in a
low, concentrated and almost fierce tone;
'I have dared and risked much for you&mdash;more
than you can conceive.  There has
seldom been aught that I have sworn to
possess that has not in time been
mine&mdash;mine, do you hear!  To those who wait,
their time and turn always come.  I have
sworn to possess you, and woe to the man
who comes between us.'
</p>

<p>
She regarded him with a haughty and
scared yet scornful eye.  She saw now
that this melo-drama was the result of
wine.
</p>

<p>
'Do you think you could compel me to
love you?' she asked, with a provoking
smile.
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'What then?'
</p>

<p>
'To marry me.'
</p>

<p>
'Under what pressure, sir?'
</p>

<p>
'That is my secret&mdash;-in time you may
find it out,' he added, bowing to her with
ominous, not mock, politeness, as she
passed him with a haughty stare, and left the
room.  'She forgets that I have yet her
photo, with her own name written on the
back in her own hand; and if ever man
put the screw on a woman by such a little
thing as that, I shall put it on you, Olive
Raymond, if you continue to play my Lady
Disdain to me!'
</p>

<p>
And for a moment he cast after her
retiring figure a glance of sardonic hate a
devil might have emulated.
</p>

<p>
'Good-bye,' he muttered, mockingly, 'is
an unpleasant thing to say; with us let it
be <i>au revoir</i> rather; perhaps she may yet
wave a damp pocket-handkerchief from the
outward wall as I ride away; who knows.'
</p>

<p>
'Sorry to say time is up, my dear fellow,'
said Lord Aberfeldie, entering the room
with his hat and driving gloves; 'make
your adieux to the ladies.  There is little
doubt that Allan has gone to Loganlee&mdash;the
covers are first-rate there.  I'll just drive
over and see, dropping you and your traps
at the railway station <i>en passant</i>.'
</p>

<p>
A few minutes more and the pair were
tooling down the avenue in a smart mail
phaeton, drawn by a pair of fine, high-stepping
dark greys.  So Lord Aberfeldie drove
'the son of his oldest friend' to the station,
and, as the distance increased between
himself and Dundargue, Holcroft's spirits
revived, as if nothing had happened there at
all; he actually said,
</p>

<p>
'And you think to find Allan at
Loganlee?'
</p>

<p>
'I haven't a doubt of it&mdash;some tift with
Olive, no doubt.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Au revoir</i>, Lord Aberfeldie! and a thousand
thanks for all your kindness to me&mdash;never
shall forget it, by Jove! but I shall
have the pleasure of seeing you all again
in town, of course.'
</p>

<p>
To this expression of pleasure Lord
Aberfeldie made no response, but shook
Holcroft's hand, whipped up his greys, and
was off, thinking,
</p>

<p>
'I am glad <i>he</i> has gone; he looks sadly
strange and queer, poor fellow.'
</p>

<p>
Holcroft was intensely relieved when
the peer had left, and, making straight
for the railway buffet, imbibed glass after
glass of pretty potent Glenlivat, conversing
affably the while with the young damsel
thereat.
</p>

<p>
'Of what are you thinking, sir, that you
stare at me so?' she asked, with a giggle.
</p>

<p>
'Only that your mother must have been
a sweetly pretty girl!'
</p>

<p>
The train was late; thus he had to spend
some time in staring aimlessly at the
flaming advertisements on the station
wall&mdash;an Anglo-American fashion now spread
to Scotland&mdash;advertisements of some one's
cocoa, some one's corsets, some one's whisky,
and so forth; and, after glancing with a
contemptuous malediction at the thick bible
left by the Scottish something society in
the little waiting-room, he smoked a cigar,
had himself weighed, had a brandy and soda,
had some more chaff with the pretty girl
at the buffet, till the night train came
snorting and clanking in, when he took his seat,
spread his rugs, and was off, as he thought,
to security at last!
</p>

<p>
Though he was not without reasonable
and selfish dread for the future, as the
night train sped on its swift way, and left
the Carse of Gowrie far behind, he felt no
genuine compunction for the atrocity he
had committed.
</p>

<p>
He did not possess a single spark of
honour, gratitude, compunction, or compassion.
By unfair play he had rooked many; he had
hocussed horses; and once ruined a poor
lad in the Lancers, on whom he contrived
to cast the suspicion of his own act.  The
Lancer was dismissed the service by sentence
of a court-martial, and shot himself next
day; and Hawke Holcroft took his luxurious
luncheon quietly in the same inn where the
inquest was held, at the same time.  He
had extorted money in many ways&mdash;he had
never precisely robbed; but never before
had he been in the dark abyss of
assassination and death till now!
</p>

<p>
The annals of our courts of justice contain
many a terrible tale of guilt; but, says
a novelist with truth, these would appear
like nothing with the history of undiscovered
and unpunished crime.  'The assassin
who accomplishes his terrible purpose so
craftily as to escape detection is a cool and
calculating fiend, by the side of whose
supreme villainy, the half-premeditated crime
of the ordinary shedder of blood, is
dwarfed into insignificance.'
</p>

<p>
So on and on sped the swift night train,
and there seemed every probability that
the deed of Holcroft would be one of the
crimes referred to, that are neither
discovered nor punished.
</p>

<p>
He gave a last look into his pocket-book
to assure himself that the cheque and the
photo of Olive were safe, and then tried to
compose himself to sleep.
</p>

<p>
Let us hope that the attempt was vain!
</p>

<p>
He could not help pondering over the
remark of Allan about how foetid the air
of the oubliette was&mdash;that the door had
not been opened for an age, and no one
ever thought of going near it.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap04"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
SUSPENSE.
</h3>

<p>
Lord Aberfeldie drove home in some
alarm and dismay.  Allan was not at
Loganlee, nor had he been near it!
When Ruby, the amber-haired little
beauty, heard of his visit and its object,
she was not slow to connect Allan's second
disappearance with some lover's quarrel
between him and Olive, and to gather
certain jealous and pleasant hopes therefrom,
for Allan was decidedly 'a weakness'
of Ruby's.
</p>

<p>
Uncertainty and suspense were
increasing now in all their minute horror at
Dundargue; while surmises proved endless,
futile, and unavailing.
</p>

<p>
He was gone&mdash;but where, or how, and
why?
</p>

<p>
'Something has happened&mdash;something
fatal&mdash;to my son!' wailed Lady Aberfeldie.
'Give me back those fatal diamonds,
Eveline.  They are never worn, that sorrow
does not come to Dundargue!'
</p>

<p>
'Take courage, my lady,' said old
Tappleton, the butler; 'ill news aye travels
fast enough, and if ought was wrang wi'
the Master, we should hae heard o't ere
now.'
</p>

<p>
Evan Cameron, now with his regiment,
and the legal agents of the family at
Edinburgh, were alike perplexed on the
receipt of letters from Lord Aberfeldie
inquiring anxiously if they knew anything
of the movements of Allan, and both
telegraphed back that they could give no
information on the subject.
</p>

<p>
With these telegrams the last hope
passed away, and when the third day of
his disappearance began to close a kind of
horror seemed to settle over the household,
and again a general, and, of course,
unavailing, search was made through the
entire neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
On the face of the servants, male and
female, there was never a smile now, as
they all loved Allan well; it was no assumed
expression they wore; but they went about
their daily work with a hushed and
subdued air as if there was death in the
house, and they fully felt the weight of
the mystery.
</p>

<p>
And ever at table stood the vacant
chair, while covers were laid as usual for
the absent one.
</p>

<p>
An accident must have happened; but
of what nature?  Lord Aberfeldie was
beginning to think grimly, vaguely, and
painfully of the future.  If aught fatal had
happened to Allan&mdash;his only son&mdash;an idea
from which his soul shrunk&mdash;his cherished
title and the grand old house of Dundargue
would pass to a remote cousin, one
who, by long residence in England, by
inter-marriage there, by training, breeding,
and habit of thought, cared no more for
Scotland and her interests, or for the
traditions of the Grahams of Aberfeldie,
than for those of Timbuctoo.
</p>

<p>
Such ideas and fears had occurred to
him once before, he could remember, when
Allan's name appeared among the list of
severely wounded in that episode of the
Afghan affair, which won him the Victoria
Cross.
</p>

<p>
To Lady Aberfeldie, such ideas, if they
occurred at all, were minor indeed to the
memories of Allan as the babe she had
nursed in her bosom, and the curly-haired
boy who had prattled at her knee; and on
whom, in manhood and his prime, she had
gazed with such maternal pride and admiration
when she saw him with the tartan and
plumed bonnet, in all the bravery of the
Black Watch.
</p>

<p>
As for poor Olive and Eveline they could
only weep together from time to time in
all the girlish abandonment of woe.
</p>

<p>
So hour by hour the silent time stole on
at Dundargue.
</p>

<p>
Till now Olive had never known how
deeply and truly she loved Allan, of the
hold his image had upon her heart; and
how she had repented the pain her
petulance must have cost him.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes in the morning light looked
weary, and yet there was an unnatural
sparkle in that weariness; her rich brown
hair, to the dismay of Mademoiselle
Clairette, was left almost undressed, and was
pushed back from her throbbing temples;
her lips, though scarlet still, looked hard,
dry, and cracked, while the whole expression
of her face seemed changed.
</p>

<p>
What was to be the clue, if ever there
would be one, to this dreadful mystery!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Meanwhile it might be inquired by the
reader whether Mr. Hawke Holcroft was
troubled by his conscience.  He certainly
never betrayed any outward signs thereof&mdash;though
conscience has been described as
making cowards of us all&mdash;but he was not
without certain reasonable and wholesome
fears of discovery and connection of the
crime with himself.
</p>

<p>
He was far away from Dundargue and
all its influences.  In fact, it seemed a kind
of dream to him the circumstance of ever
having been there at all; and as weeks
passed on nothing could exceed his perplexity
and astonishment, though located in an
obscure corner of London to avoid his
creditors and, <i>pro tem.</i>, everyone else, to
hear nothing of the affair at Dundargue or
of the Master being missing.
</p>

<p>
Sedulously he searched the daily prints,
sedulously he watched the sensational
portions of the evening third and fourth
editions, but the matter was never referred to.
No advertisements appeared offering
rewards; no detectives, or the usual
machinery seemed to have been put in motion.
What could it all mean&mdash;this silence and
mystery?
</p>

<p>
Everything however trivial finds its way
into print now, and the son of a peer&mdash;and
an officer in Her Majesty's service,
too&mdash;does not vanish every day!
</p>

<p>
At last he got a shock, when a poster
proclaimed in large capitals '<i>The mysterious
outrage at Dun&mdash;</i>' but his sight failed him
for a moment, and when again he looked
he perceived that it was not Dundargue,
but 'Dunecht,' that was mentioned with
reference to the affair of a past time.
</p>

<p>
But in all this we are somewhat anticipating.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
THE OUBLIETTE.
</h3>

<p>
In these unromantic, plodding, prosaic
days of railways, telegraphs, and telephones
who would imagine that the fine old family
mansion of Dundargue would be the scene
of a crime&mdash;of a tragedy&mdash;suited only to
the days of the Sir Malise Graham of the
fourteenth century?
</p>

<p>
Yet so it was.
</p>

<p>
Allan was not killed&mdash;he was perhaps one
of those fellows who are not easily killed&mdash;but
he was severely injured by the fall and
concussion, and it was long before he
began to struggle back into a consciousness
of existence, as he had fallen partly on his
head and left shoulder.
</p>

<p>
The former had suffered from that
circumstance, and from the dreadful blow
dealt him by Hawke Holcroft; and he
was not slow in discovering that his left
arm was useless&mdash;broken above the elbow.
</p>

<p>
'Thank heaven, it is not my sword arm!'
he whispered, huskily, as he strove to
stagger up; but only to sink helplessly down
again on the cold stone floor of his prison.
</p>

<p>
He was too weak&mdash;too confused to feel
either just rage or indignation yet.  There
was a horrible dream-like sense of utter
unreality in the whole situation in which
he so suddenly found himself, and some
time elapsed before the whole episode with
Holcroft&mdash;his unfortunate offer to show
him this fatal place, the situation and
character of which had suddenly suggested the
crime&mdash;their idling in the picture-gallery,
smoking and wandering through corridors,
up and down ancient stairs, with eventually
a sudden recollection of the whole
adventure&mdash;surged into his brain, and a gasp
of rage escaped him.
</p>

<p>
'Accursed coward and villain!' muttered
Allan, looking upward; but all was
darkness there and around him.
</p>

<p>
The hours stole on.  He staggered up,
and at last began to explore the place in
which he found himself&mdash;a somewhat needless
act, as he knew it but too well, having
many a time, when a boy, with fear,
awe, and curiosity, lowered down a candle
at the end of a string, and seen it swaying
to and fro far down below till the damp
vapour extinguished the flame.
</p>

<p>
Yet he felt with his right hand the
circular wall of massive masonry which enclosed
him, carefully again and again, in the
desperate hope of finding some outlet, though
he knew well by the history and traditions
of the place that no such thing could ever
have existed; but he could not remain still
or withstand the nervous desire for
exertion&mdash;to be up and doing something; till
again he sank on the floor in utter weariness
of heart, albeit that heart was aflame
with rage.
</p>

<p>
He uttered shouts for help from time to
time, till his voice became hoarse and began
to fail him, and his spirit too, as he knew
the enormous thickness of the old walls
around him; and tears of rage almost
escaped him as he pondered over the cold
and calculating villainy, of which he was
now so mysteriously the helpless victim.
</p>

<p>
He had no doubt that the hours of the
night were now stealing on, and that long
ere this his absence must have been discovered,
and speculation would be rife.  He
had his watch, but he was in utter and
blackest darkness, and his box of cigar lights
having dropped from his pocket he had no
means of consulting the dial.
</p>

<p>
He could but lie there in great pain and
passive misery&mdash;a misery that seemed so
unnatural that it was like a nightmare, an
unreality, that must pass away as suddenly
as it had come upon him.
</p>

<p>
How terrible and indescribable, however,
grew his aching thoughts as the weary
time went on!
</p>

<p>
He might die of cold, of hunger, of agony&mdash;die
within a few yards of his own hearthstone&mdash;die
thus under his father's roof, and
close by where at that very moment the
whole family were a prey to bewilderment
and distress by his sudden disappearance!
</p>

<p>
Oh, it was all too maddening to think of.
So there he could but lie, buried, immured,
entombed in darkness; chill as death, not
a breath of pure air in his nostrils; not the
faintest glimmer of light, and no human
sound in his ears.  As the hours crept on
he could scarcely distinguish waking from
sleeping, a dream from reality; and at times
all seemed to become chaos, and he could
think of nothing unless it were a buzzing
in his head and the acute agony of his
broken arm.
</p>

<p>
Anon he would utter a feeble shout for
'help,' but his own voice seemed to return
to him; beyond the walls that enclosed him
it would not go.  He knew that there are
situations in life incident to misery and
painful excitement, when the human machinery
by the rapidity of mental action is worn
out sooner than its alloted time, and he
began to consider how long it was possible
to exist without food or water.
</p>

<p>
Wearily, agonisingly the hours dragged on.
</p>

<p>
By this time he was certain that night
had passed and day had come again; and
what must the thoughts of his people be?
Inquiries and searches would be made he
knew, but who would ever dream of
searching for him where he was <i>then</i>.
</p>

<p>
He had not yet begun to suffer from
hunger, but he had a considerable thirst,
and hunger would come too.
</p>

<p>
He thought of all he had read of the
endurance of men on rafts and in open
boats at sea; of entombed miners buried
deep in the bowels of the earth, and his
hair seemed to bristle up at the
recollections.  Hunger, thirst, and an unknown
death&mdash;or death at such craven hands.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, God,' he moaned, 'will aid never&mdash;never come?'
</p>

<p>
In that gruesome place and time there
occurred to him&mdash;ghastly memory!&mdash;thoughts
of the unknown and forgotten
dead whose matted bones had been found
in it by antiquarian explorers, as he had
mentioned to Holcroft&mdash;the remains of
unfortunate creatures flung in there by his
forefathers.
</p>

<p>
Could it be that this unlooked-for fate
of his was to be a species of expiation for
them?  And was he to die now by this
death, when life had become to him so much
dearer than ever?
</p>

<p>
If his disappearance remained utterly
unaccounted for, and his death became&mdash;as
of course it would be&mdash;a thing of the
past, and forgotten even by those to whom
he was dear, might not Hawke Holcroft
regain such influence as he had ever
possessed over Olive and make her his own?
She would be free then; there would be no
obstacle, and no other rendering of the
will necessary, now that <i>he</i> was removed.
</p>

<p>
Never again to see her face or the faces
of those he loved and who loved him so;
to die a rat's death, within arm's length of
them almost!  Could his ancestor have
foreseen, when he formed this infernal trap,
that one of his own race was to perish
therein, and thus!
</p>

<p>
After a time, amid all this tangle of
terrible thoughts, he began to forget where
he was; his senses partly left him; he
believed himself to be with the regiment&mdash;the
Black Watch, with their dark tartans
and historic crimson plumes; he heard the
crash of the drums, the braying of the
pipes, and saw many familiar faces around
him, those of Cameron and Carslogie
among others.  Now the regiment was
going into action; he saw the line forming,
the eyes of the men lighting grimly up as
they loaded, and the sunshine flashed upon
the ridges of levelled steel.  The dream
seemed a palpable one, and, with a shout
louder than he thought he could utter, he
called upon them to follow him in the
charge!
</p>

<p>
His own cry awoke or roused him; the
glorious vision of the charging line melted
into opaque darkness, and now Allan found
himself weaker than ever.  He thought all
was nearly over with him now.  He turned
his thoughts to prayer, ere it might be too
late, and from pondering on release and
vengeance and the things of this life, he
began to think, as his powers ebbed, of the
life to come.
</p>

<p>
He felt that he must resign himself to
the inevitable, and to die&mdash;to die there
after all, and at last he became totally
insensible.

<p><a id="chap06"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
CEAD MILLE MALOCH!
</h3>

<p>
The shout uttered by Allan in his delirium
had not been uttered in vain.
</p>

<p>
It chanced that Mr. Tappleton, the
silver-haired old butler, who had been
custodier of the wine binns and the massive
old plate in its iron-bound chest, since
the present Lord Aberfeldie was a baby in
long clothes, had entered his dusty and
cobwebbed repositories, and was seeking
through their stone shelves for some fine
old crusted port of a peculiar vintage,
kept alone for the use of his master and
himself, when the cry of Allan and some
other strange sounds reached his ears, as he
thought, and seriously startled him.
</p>

<p>
We say he thought, for the recess of his
wine binns was an unlikely place to hear
any other sound than that made by a scared
rat.
</p>

<p>
It was now the dead, dull silence of
midnight, when the sounds that are
unknown amid the buzz of mid-day life are
heard, and seem so oddly, so preternaturally
loud and strange&mdash;a crack in a door
panel or wainscot, the tap of a moth against
the window-panes, distant noises that come
we know not how or from what on the still
damp air.
</p>

<p>
In a country house at night there is
usually a solemn stillness that is painful
and oppressive to the wakeful; and it was
amidst this silence, the cry&mdash;for a human
cry it was&mdash;reached the butler's startled ear.
</p>

<p>
But whence had it come?  Out of the
stone wall, or from the ground beneath, or
from the throat of a raven in one of the
great chimneys of the old house?
</p>

<p>
'Impossible!' thought Tappleton; 'it
was the voice of a man&mdash;or a ghost.'
</p>

<p>
At the latter idea he closed the wine-binn
door, and retired with precipitation to
his cosy room, and thought the matter
over as he stirred and sipped his hot
whisky toddy, but feeling ever and anon
that wild throbbing of the heart, and 'that
electric chill and rising of the hair which
accompanies supernatural panic.'
</p>

<p>
The old man had a most uncomfortable
feeling about the voice he had heard, and
its strangely muffled sound seemed to come
in fancy to his ear again and again; and
now he, not unnaturally, began to associate
it with the mysterious disappearance of
Allan, the Master.
</p>

<p>
With earliest dawn he betook himself to
his wine cellar again, and felt that he was
a bolder man in daylight than in the gloom
of midnight; but 'most men are,' says
Charles Dickens; yet when an unmistakable
moan or two reached his ears, his fear
of the supernatural so nearly gained the
ascendancy that he was about to take to
flight again.
</p>

<p>
However he paused, while his old heart
beat painfully, and began to think of what
adjoined his cellars, and at once there
flashed upon his memory the locality of the
horrible old vault; for the butler knew all
the 'outs and ins' of Dundargue as well as
if he had built it.
</p>

<p>
In the course of modern alterations
and repairs a portion of the originally
enormous wall of the vault had been
thinned and cut away.  There were crannies
in the masonry, and it was through these
the voice of the imprisoned had reached
the butler during his casual visit to his
cellar.
</p>

<p>
'Some one is there.  Good Heavens! if
it should be the Master&mdash;the Master after
a'!' exclaimed Tappleton; and, quick as his
old legs could carry him, he rushed up
stairs, through the picture-gallery, along
the arched corridor, and reached at last
the oak trap-door; but when he saw it,
with its great iron hasp over the rusted
staple, hope died away, and his soul sank
within him.
</p>

<p>
Loth to linger in a place where, as we
have stated, superstition believed that
those who did so, had a creeping sense of
having near them shadowy forms and
intangible presences, he was on the point of
turning away, when, controlling his silly
fears, he thought he might as well pursue
his investigations further.
</p>

<p>
He raised the trap-door, and almost
immediately a voice ascended to his ear from
the darkness below.  He peered down, but
could see nothing.
</p>

<p>
'Wha is there&mdash;wha spoke?' asked the
butler.
</p>

<p>
'I&mdash;I, the Master,' replied the weak
voice of Allan Graham.
</p>

<p>
'You, sir&mdash;heaven be gude tae us!  You
sir! hoo in God's name cam' ye to be doon
there?' cried Tappleton, in mingled joy,
horror, and great perplexity.
</p>

<p>
'Summon help&mdash;there's a good old
fellow; get me out, and then you will know
all&mdash;quick, Tappleton, or&mdash;or I shall not
last much longer,' replied Allan, faintly,
and at intervals, in a voice so low that his
last words seemed to die away, while Tappleton
rushed off as fast as his years would
permit, to seek Lord Aberfeldie and alarm
the whole household, which he did very
effectually by a sudden and furious application
to the great house-bell, causing a
very general idea of fire, and bringing all
from their rooms in various kinds of
<i>d√©shabille</i> at that early hour of the morning.
</p>

<p>
'The Master's found&mdash;the Master's
found!' he kept shouting on every hand.
</p>

<p>
'Where&mdash;where?' asked twenty voices.
</p>

<p>
'Ay, ye may weel ask <i>whar</i>,' was the
tantalizing response.
</p>

<p>
In the breast of Lord Aberfeldie and all
his household incredulity at first, and then
profound astonishment, reigned for a time
on the butler making himself understood,
and all hastened to the scene of his
discovery.
</p>

<p>
'The Master&mdash;the Master down there,'
muttered the servants, looking inquiringly
in each other's faces.  'How came such a
thing to pass?'
</p>

<p>
They jostled and impeded each other;
but Lord Aberfeldie's authority and
soldier-like promptitude soon defined a line
of action.
</p>

<p>
'Lights&mdash;lights and ropes; look alive,
men!' he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
These requisites were soon brought.
</p>

<p>
'Lower away&mdash;take courage&mdash;we'll soon
have you out,' exclaimed his father.  'Tie
the ropes tightly round you.'
</p>

<p>
Allan, in a faint voice, made them aware
that this was impossible, as his left arm
was broken, tidings which added
commiseration and grief to the blank
amazement of Olive, Eveline, and his mother.
</p>

<p>
'Who will go down?' asked Lord Aberfeldie,
looking around him.
</p>

<p>
'I&mdash;and I&mdash;and I!'
</p>

<p>
Every man in the house was ready to
descend, but Angus Glas, the active young
deerstalker, slid down the rope with a
lanthorn in his hand, followed by the
prayer of Olive, who would not be kept
back, her eyes wild, her now pale lips apart,
her sweet face blanched, and a strange
stiffness in all her usually lithe limbs.
</p>

<p>
Pale as death, his face plastered with
dried blood&mdash;blood that had flowed from a
contusion in his head&mdash;livid and helpless,
his left arm hanging limp as an empty
sleeve by his side, his eyes half closed, as
if unable to endure the glare of the day
after being so long in the dark, Allan was
brought up, and, on beholding him, the
exclamations of commiseration and
astonishment redoubled; and yet it could be
seen that he was almost past questioning,
and mounted grooms were instantly
despatched to summon all the medical aid of
the district.
</p>

<p>
Had the butler's nocturnal visit to his
binns been twenty-four hours later, Allan
Graham must have perished, and his fate
might never have been known in his own
generation perhaps.
</p>

<p>
The whole catastrophe seemed so strange,
unintelligible, unnatural, and harrowing
that the nerves of Lady Aberfeldie were
terribly shaken by it; so were those of her
daughter and Olive, and each needed all
the comfort and support the other could
give.
</p>

<p>
Some wine, which he drank thirstily,
first revived the patient after he was
conveyed to his room.
</p>

<p>
'How in the name of heaven, Allan,
came you to fall into that place?' asked his
father.
</p>

<p>
'I did not fall in,' replied Allan, in a
species of husky whisper.
</p>

<p>
'How then?'
</p>

<p>
'Holcroft!' was all Allan could utter,
when the room seemed to swim round him
and he became insensible.
</p>

<p>
Lord Aberfeldie knew not precisely
what to make of the reply, but suspicion
gave him a certain clue to what he thought
had happened, and the same idea seemed
to occur to young Angus, the gillie, who
was assisting to undress his master and
put him to bed, for his eyes gleamed under
their shaggy brows, and he could only
mutter from time to time,
</p>

<p>
'<i>Cead mille maloch!</i>'
</p>

<p>
A malediction in which Lord Aberfeldie
heartily concurred.
</p>

<p>
When ultimately the Peer learned all
that had transpired, the incident of the
cheque he had so innocently and generously
given Holcroft was completely forgotten.
He felt only rage, mingled with utter
stupefaction, that a man could act so
basely as his recent guest had done.  It was
altogether out of his calculation and
experience of human life in every way.
</p>

<p>
'But what is to be done now&mdash;to search
out and punish this malignant scoundrel?'
he exclaimed; while Lady Aberfeldie, all
her motherly feelings outraged, was for
raising fire and sword, and letting loose
all the terrors of the law on Holcroft's
head.
</p>

<p>
Lord Aberfeldie, however, after a time
thought differently.  He had a horror of
publicity, of newspaper gossip and scandals,
of making his honoured and ancestral
home and the affairs of his family a <i>point
d'appui</i>, as he said, for such things&mdash;a
world's wonder, even for a time; and thus
he declined to attempt to punish Holcroft
for an outrage none had seen him commit.
</p>

<p>
He would leave that to the course of
events, and to Time, the avenger.
</p>

<p>
More than all, the name of Olive
Raymond might crop up in the unseemly
matter.
</p>

<p>
'His father was a brave, good fellow,
and my dearest friend!' said Lord Aberfeldie
sadly; 'how comes his son to be such
an utter villain?  He has drawn his evil
tendencies from some past generation; it is
said that such a kind of poison is at times
transmitted in the blood, and that no human
being can truly value the resistance of sin
or folly.'
</p>

<p>
But Lady Aberfeldie was stormy, and
declined to be pacified.
</p>

<p>
'We have the future to think of,' said
her husband again; 'evil tongues to guard
against for the sake of Olive, our whole
family, and my old comrade the General,
who is now in his grave&mdash;the father of that
foul ingrate.'
</p>

<p>
Thus it was that no mention of the
affair was made by the daily prints, to the
surprise, certainly, and perhaps the relief, of
Holcroft's mind.
</p>

<p>
'Say no more on this subject, Eveline,'
said Lord Aberfeldie, as he sought to soothe
his wife.  'Gladly would I forget that we
had ever sheltered at Dundargue a guest
so degrading in character; gladly would I
forget as soon as possible&mdash;if it be
possible&mdash;the hours of intense suffering we have
undergone, more than all that Allan must
have undergone in that horrible place, and
yet under his own roof!'
</p>

<p>
Many a silent and reproachful tear Olive
shed in secret, as she knew, in the recent
past time, how much her pride, petulance,
and suspicion had done to further jealousy
and resentment in the mind of Holcroft
against her cousin; and she felt that too
probably she had caused all this.
</p>

<p>
But Holcroft was a bankrupt and a
blackleg now, and never more, at London
or anywhere else, she thought, could he
cross <i>her</i> path again.  Till now she never
believed that the world could contain a
man so utterly unprincipled, so thoroughly
base!
</p>

<p>
The household servants supposed that
the Master had fallen into that gruesome
vault by accident, and they were allowed
to adopt the idea.
</p>

<p>
'But who closed the trap and dropped
the hasp over the staple?' thought old
Tappleton; yet eventually he allowed himself
to be talked into the idea that he had
made a mistake in that matter.
</p>

<p>
Allan lay long ill and delirious after all he
had undergone; but when it was announced
that he was past danger, great was
the rejoicing of all the servants and the
household at Dundargue, for all loved the
Master well, and were faithfully attached
to the family by ties of residence and
clanship, even in this Victorian age.  'The
devoted loyalty of the clansmen to their
chiefs existed undiminished for generations
after the system of clan government was
abolished in 1746,' said the <i>Standard</i>
newspaper recently; 'and it would be wholly
erroneous to contend, <i>even now</i>, that the
peculiar affection between the people and
their chief, altogether different in nature
and degree from any relationship known
in a Saxon community, has died away.'
</p>

<p>
But the family of Aberfeldie had not
seen the last of Mr. Hawke Holcroft.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
LOVERS.
</h3>

<p>
The early days of the spring subsequent to
the events we have narrated, found the
Aberfeldie family located at Maviswood, a
handsome modern villa to the west of
Edinburgh, whither they had removed from
Dundargue, that Allan, on whom a kind of
protracted illness had fallen, might avail
himself of the great medical skill which is
always to be found in the Scottish Metropolis.
</p>

<p>
By what means Allan was discovered
and got out of the vault into which he had
been flung, and, as Hawke Holcroft hoped,
was entombed for ever, the latter never
knew, from the plan adopted by the family,
but the public prints had informed him
more than once, that 'the Master of
Aberfeldie had met with an accident&mdash;a
fall&mdash;from the effects of which he was slowly
recovering; wounds received when on
service with the Black Watch retarding his
progress to health.'
</p>

<p>
Evan Cameron, Carslogie, and others of
the regiment, then in the Castle of
Edinburgh, heard of Allan's affair or illness in
a vague way, as Lord Aberfeldie shrunk
from all gossip, publicity and surmise;
and the first-named learned that Eveline's
marriage had been delayed in consequence
of that illness, chiefly through a letter
written to him by Olive, at Allan's request.
</p>

<p>
So the early days of spring were passing
on, and no particular change had taken
place in the relative positions of our
characters since we last saw them at Dundargue.
</p>

<p>
Eveline was alone one afternoon in a
room at Maviswood&mdash;a room of vast
proportions.  The ceiling was divided into
deep panels of oak colour; a dado of dead
gold tint was carried round the walls to
within eight feet of the cornice, and the
chairs and ottomans were upholstered in
blue maroquin leather, studded with
elaborate gilt nails.  The hangings were
blue, with yellow borders, lining and
tassels; great china bowls, full of
conservatory flowers, stood on ornate tables and
pedestals, within the recess of a great
triple bay window, beyond which spread
away southward the lovely landscape that
is bounded by the Pentlands.
</p>

<p>
Spring is a lovely and joyous season
everywhere, but nowhere is it lovelier than
in the fertile Lothians; and nowhere may
the eye rest upon a more varied and
beautiful landscape than that which spreads
from the southern slope of Corstorphine's
wooded crags to the base of the green
and undulating Pentlands, the highest
summits of which range from sixteen
hundred to nearly nineteen hundred feet.
</p>

<p>
There are corn-fields teeming with fertility,
rows of stately trees, pretty cottages,
stately white manor houses, and cosy
farms embosomed among old woods and
orchards; the picturesque rocks of wooded
Craiglockhart, wherein the kites and
kestrels build their nests; the rich alluvial
land, where for ages a great loch once
spread its waters; the quaint old village
church, on the spire of which the red
sunset loves to linger; and westward the
Queen of the North, in all the glory of
castled rock, and hill and crag, spire,
tower, and countless terraces; and on all
of these the wistful eyes of Eveline
Grahame were wandering dreamily.
</p>

<p>
A golden glory was cast along the
eastern slopes, the fleecy clouds were every
moment assuming new forms and lovelier
colours; the woods were budding forth;
the Leith and its tiny tributaries were
brawling along as if their waters had no
time to toy with the brown pebbles.
Seated, at times, sideways on their horses,
the happy ploughboys were already going
home from their labours.  The early-yeaned
lambs were frisking about the ewes,
and cloud and sunshine seemed to chase
each other over the tender grass, where
the wild white gowan was opening its
petals, and old folks were remembering
that 'a peck o' March dust was worth the
ransom o' a king.'
</p>

<p>
Of late, Eveline's bursts of girlish
merriment had been few and far between.  She
was fretful&mdash;unusually so for a girl who
by nature was so sweet and gentle, and at
the mere mention of the name of Sir
Paget&mdash;to whom she felt herself doomed, as it
were, or allotted&mdash;she became more fretful,
silent, and abstracted.
</p>

<p>
She shrank from smiling people, turned
her back upon inquisitive ones, and often
was found to answer briefly and beside the
point.
</p>

<p>
In short, the pretty Eveline's heart or
mind was quite unhinged.
</p>

<p>
The tenth day of her residence at Maviswood
was creeping slowly on, and she was
pondering, full of thought, alone in that
stately room, when a servant startled her
by announcing and ushering in 'Mr. Evan
Cameron,' and, though her mind was full
of him&mdash;of the evening of the carpet-dance
at Dundargue, and the hour of joy in the
half-lit corridor, a kind of gasp escaped her
as she rose from her seat to receive him.
</p>

<p>
But why should he not call, reason
suggested to her.
</p>

<p>
The Grahams had been for ten days, we
have said, at Maviswood; and Cameron,
who had been counting every hour of those
ten days, and watching the villa with his
field-glass from his quarters in the distant
castle, had now ventured to make an
afternoon walk, and found, beyond his
hopes, that Eveline was alone.
</p>

<p>
Allan and Olive were out together in a
pony-phaeton; Lord and Lady Aberfeldie
were he cared not where; anyway, they
were absent too.
</p>

<p>
Olive, feeling that she was in some way
responsible, by her past thoughtlessness,
petulance, and flirting with the daring and
unworthy Holcroft, for much that had
befallen Allan, now 'waited on him hand
and foot,' as the old nurse Nannie phrased
it.  She was with him from hour to hour,
and, though their marriage was delayed,
how happy they seemed to be!
</p>

<p>
Fearing interruption as before, Cameron,
too tender and true not to be a timid lover,
found a difficulty just then in taking up
the thread of the old story, and they stood
in the bay-window talking commonplaces,
while heart was speaking to heart and eye
to eye.  But 'what is speaking or hearing
when heart wells into heart?'
</p>

<p>
Cameron heard all she chose then to tell
him about Allan's 'accident,' the
bewilderment and alarm of the family, and so
forth.  Many friends were spoken of, but Sir
Paget was of course referred to by neither.
</p>

<p>
Eveline, though so young, had the frank
and perfect air of repose in her manner
that came of gentle breeding, and made
her seem older than she was, but gave an
assurance that whatever she said, or
whatever she did, was said and done in the
right way.  Without coquetry, her manner
was full of simple fascination; but it was
undeniably nervous now, for she read by
Cameron's softened voice, and in his
brightening eye, the clear necessity for
something else than common-place talk,
when he discovered by a casual remark that
Lord and Lady Aberfeldie were not in the
house.
</p>

<p>
Eveline felt that she had given herself
to Evan, and that the tenor of their
interview in the corridor amounted tacitly to
an engagement.
</p>

<p>
An engagement!  But to what end?
It all seemed but a dream, a delicious
dream, of which there was nothing to
remind her, not even a ring, a lock of hair,
or the tiniest note.
</p>

<p>
Unlike Cameron, Eveline, while loving
him dearly, had, singular to say, no
thought of marriage with him in the
ordinary sense of the word; for, hemmed
round as she was, and destined as she was,
the idea was a hopeless one, judged from
her parents' point of view.  She only felt,
poor girl, that she loved, and was full of
sad joy&mdash;if we may use the paradox&mdash;in
the belief that she was truly loved in
return.
</p>

<p>
'How silent you have become,' she said,
in a low tone, after a nervous pause.
</p>

<p>
'I know not what to say; but love has
no need of words, Eveline, nor needs he
many at any time,' he replied, drawing
closer to her.  Then he took a conservatory
rose from a vase and exclaimed,
'Eveline darling, you love me well and
truly, don't you?'
</p>

<p>
'Well and truly, you know, dear Evan,'
she replied, as his arm went round her,
and her head dropped on his shoulder.
'What need to ask me?' she whispered, in
a breathless voice.
</p>

<p>
'Because I cannot hear the beloved
assurance too often.'  He kissed her
tenderly, we cannot say how many times, nor
would it matter, while she lay passive in
his arms, and then he said, 'Shall we try
our fate with this rose?'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'By plucking it, leaf by leaf, saying each
time "Lucky, Unlucky," till the last leaf
comes.'
</p>

<p>
'Something <i>√† la Marguerite</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'No, decidedly no, dearest Evan.'
</p>

<p>
'You are superstitious.  Well, so am I.'
</p>

<p>
'Thus an omen would only torment
us, and surely we have
enough&mdash;enough&mdash;&mdash;'  Tears choked her voice,
and she could only add, 'Trust, dearest
Evan, trust.'
</p>

<p>
'In what, my darling?'
</p>

<p>
'The great goodness of God.'
</p>

<p>
The spell of a great love was on
both.  Their lips met in a long and silent
kiss, and the rose fell at their feet between
them.
</p>

<p>
A sound roused them&mdash;nay, startled
them.  They had only time to separate
and affect a sudden interest in the artistic
effects produced by light and shadow on the
landscape, when Lord and Lady Aberfeldie
entered the room together, a pretty palpable
cloud of annoyance resting on the
brows of both as they politely, but far
from warmly, greeted the visitor.
</p>

<p>
The peer, who had evidently been out
riding, appeared in a black morning coat
and white cords, whip in hand, and the
lady, who had been in the grounds, wore
her garden hat and shawl.  She had seen
a visitor ride up to the door from a distant
part of the lawn, and had hurried home,
her heart foreboding truly who that visitor was.
</p>

<p>
And now, while their hearts were vibrating
with tenderness, and with their lips
yet tremulously sensible of the sweetness
of kisses&mdash;the first kisses of a new and
early love&mdash;they had to talk enforced
commonplace&mdash;or, at least, Evan did so, while
Eveline remained silent&mdash;of the news of
the day, the expected plans of the ministry,
the probable despatch of a fleet to
Egyptian waters, of the chances of an army
following it, of Arabi Pasha and the Khedive,
the plot formed by the Circassian officers,
and so forth, till it was time for the
lingering Cameron to resume his hat and
depart at last.
</p>

<p>
Cameron tried to ignore that which,
under other and more prosperous
circumstances, would have galled and roused his
haughty Highland spirit&mdash;Lord Aberfeldie's
coldness of manner when he spoke
even of the regiment, and how certainly it
would go to the East, 'as the Black Watch,
thank God, was always in everything, and
always with honour,' while Evan's eyes
irresistibly wandered to the face of Eveline,
and memory went back to the twilighted
corridor at Dundargue.
</p>

<p>
But so did the memory of my Lord Aberfeldie.
</p>

<p>
The peer must have undergone a good
deal of training or "drilling" lately at the
hands of Lady Aberfeldie before he could
have brought himself to behave so coldly
to one he really liked so well as young
Stratherroch, and one of the Black Watch
especially; but then, perhaps, he was just
a little soured by the sequel to the hospitality
and kindness accorded to "the son of
his old friend," which son had contrived
by skilful lettering and figuring to add the
sum of eighty pounds to his cheque.
</p>

<p>
As he bade them adieu Stratherroch
observed that Lord Aberfeldie did not ask
him to call again at Maviswood, and keenly
did he feel the omission and all it implied,
and with it came the conviction that he
must call no more!
</p>

<p>
Slowly he rode back to his quarters full
of alternately exultant and bitter
thoughts&mdash;exultant that Eveline loved him and
would never cease to love him, but bitter
ones as he asked himself, to what end!
</p>

<p>
If poor Cameron had vague and lingering
hopes to which he clung (and doubtless
he had)&mdash;hopes when seeing Eveline, of
proposing or hinting of meeting elsewhere
in the future&mdash;they were doomed to blight,
for no such bore fruition; and they had
now parted, and her father and mother
thought they should part, as mere friends,
who might meet casually in society, but at
all events had better <i>not</i> meet again.
</p>

<p>
And Cameron feared that, so far as monetary
matters stood with him, his friend
Allan might endorse the same view of the
situation.
</p>

<p>
'Stratherroch is a gentleman by birth
and position, but poor, miserably poor,'
said Lady Aberfeldie, after he had gone;
'so was that precious Mr. Holcroft, and
when a declension takes place in tone,
manner, and habits, as in his instance, we
never know where it may end,' she added
pointedly to Eveline.
</p>

<p>
'How can you speak of the two men in
the same sentence!' exclaimed the peer,
with an asperity for which his daughter
thanked him in her aching heart.
</p>

<p>
At anytime when Eveline looked
south-eastward from Maviswood she could see the
Castle of Edinburgh, and the towering
mass of the western barrack, with all its
windows shining in the sun, and she always
did so with tenderest interest, as she knew
that <i>he</i> was there; but, natheless, her
experience of at least one London season,
there was much of the guileless child and
mere girl in Eveline still, and she was
so sweet and soft, so pliable, and so
impressed with her mother's will and her
father's authority, that&mdash;that how could
Evan Cameron tell what pressure might
be brought to bear upon her, to make her
seem to transfer the allegiance of her heart
to another&mdash;even to the wealthy old
English baronet, Sir Paget Puddicombe?
</p>

<p>
Alas! there was to be, in time, a pressure
that none could then foresee.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
AT MAVISWOOD.
</h3>

<p>
The reports which Mr. Hawke Holcroft&mdash;spinning
out his precarious existence by
skill with the billiard cue, cards, and the
betting ring&mdash;heard concerning the health
of his intended victim, one whom he still
absurdly and grotesquely deemed his
successful rival, were undoubtedly true.
</p>

<p>
With all his natural strength.  Allan
Graham recovered but slowly from all he
had undergone, and the many hours he had
lingered in that vault with his fractured
limb unset, together with the effect of
certain sabre wounds received when he served
in India, retarded his progress to restoration;
but amid his protracted convalescence
how sweet it was, as the pleasant days of
sunny spring stole on at Maviswood, to have
the society, the hourly care and attendance
of Olive, in whom he was always, he thought,
discovering some new charm of mind or
grace of manner, with much soft
tenderness of heart and hand.
</p>

<p>
Thus, twice&mdash;once in India and again
at home&mdash;rescued, as it were, from the
verge of death, he had learned the sweetness
of life, and that, whatever its sufferings
and sorrows may be, what a priceless
gift it is&mdash;a reflection that never occurred
to him when going under fire, or leading
a line of Highlanders in their headlong
charge.
</p>

<p>
Lady Aberfeldie was content and happy;
Evan Cameron seemed now a banished
man; even Allan never spoke of him, and
the progress of matters between the
cousins proved all she could desire.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing could be more fortunate, dearest
Olive, than the attachment which now
subsists between you and Allan; it fulfils
all your father's fondest wishes,' said she,
as she met them one day in the garden,
slowly promenading between the flowerbeds,
Allan leaning, or affecting to do so,
on the soft, round arm of Olive.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, mother dear&mdash;I agree with you,
and also with Peter Simple,' replied Allan,
smiling.
</p>

<p>
'In what?'
</p>

<p>
'That the life of a man seems to consist
of getting into scrapes, and then getting
out of them again.'
</p>

<p>
'And you forget now that I ever teased
and tormented you so, my poor Allan,'
said Olive, patting his rather pale cheek
with her pinky palm.
</p>

<p>
'Of course I do, darling.  I am not
much of a philosopher, but Balzac is right
in his view of human life&mdash;that it would
be intolerable without a vast amount of
forgetting.'
</p>

<p>
'And forgiving, too, he might have
added,' said Olive, as she tendered her lips
playfully and poutingly for a kiss, which
he was not slow in according.
</p>

<p>
Poor Eveline, as she watched this happy
pair daily under her eyes, sighed with
natural and irrepressible envy; she thought
of her own love for Evan Cameron&mdash;secret,
ignored, and so liable to excite maternal
scorn and bitterness, with paternal
reprehension, when it came on the <i>tapis</i>; while
even Allan, at all times so loving and so
brotherly, amid the great selfishness or
absorption of his own passion, seemed, as
she thought, to have withdrawn his
sympathy from her now.
</p>

<p>
One circumstance she deemed most
fortunate&mdash;Parliament was sitting, and Sir
Paget Puddicombe was in London.
</p>

<p>
It would seem, then, that between the
botheration of Ireland and the interests
of Egypt the affairs of Slough-cum-Sloggit&mdash;monetary,
municipal, and commercial&mdash;were
as likely to be forgotten and ignored
as if that quiet borough had actually been
an integral part of Scotland&mdash;a state of
matters not to be tolerated.  So Sir Paget
was in his place at Westminster, jerking
his head and puffing out his chest more
than ever, and Eveline was freed for a
time from his presence, and the would-be
lover-like regard of his suspicious and
keenly-critical old eyes.
</p>

<p>
And she knew not that almost daily, the
moment that he was free from duty or
parade was over, Evan, drawn by an irrepressible
craving and desire to be near her&mdash;to
see the roof under which she dwelt,
the windows through which she might
be looking, the trees under which she
might be walking, was always hovering in
the vicinity of Maviswood; while, by a
strange fatality, she, filled by a similar
desire, might be riding with her father, or
driving with her mother, through stately
George Street, along the magnificent
terrace of Princes Street, and other great
thoroughfares, looking eagerly, but in
vain, for a chance glimpse of him, and
perhaps a bow&mdash;a mere bow, and nothing
more.
</p>

<p>
Circumstanced as they were, what more
could she look for?
</p>

<p>
Twice only, and at long intervals, did
she see Evan, and on each occasion how
wildly did her loving heart beat as she
detected his well-known figure; but he saw
not her, as she rode slowly on by her
father's side, who, if he saw Evan on the
first occasion, steadily ignored the fact,
and stared up at the Castle ramparts, where
the sentinels of the Black Watch trod
slowly to and fro.
</p>

<p>
Certainly Evan did not see her.  He
was on the garden side of Princes Street
the wooded walk which somewhat resembles
a continental boulevard&mdash;in close
conversation with a young lady, who seemed
to listen to all he was saying with great
<i>empressement</i>.
</p>

<p>
The second time she saw him was after
an interval of some days, in the same place,
at the same hour, and with the same fair
companion, to whom her father&mdash;thinking,
no doubt, to utilise the circumstance&mdash;drew
her attention somewhat pointedly.
</p>

<p>
'Cameron <i>again</i>!' said he; 'our friend
seems to find other attractions in the
gardens than trees or spring flowers.'
</p>

<p>
Eveline's heart beat painfully, and the
second episode gave her occasion for much
and rather harassing thought.  Her father,
by this remark, showed that he had
observed Evan before; but who was the
latter's companion?
</p>

<p>
Eveline blushed violently up to where
the brim of her smart riding-hat pressed
her bright brown hair upon her brow, and
down to where a stiff and snow-white
linen collar encircled her slender white
neck; then she grew very pale with
constrained emotion, which, fortunately, her
father did not detect.
</p>

<p>
She did not speak, but pretended to
smile, with an effort of self-mastery, while
a lump seemed to rise in her slender
throat; for though the circumstance of
Evan, who was debarred from coming to
see her, being seen there again with the
same young lady might be a casualty, a
trivial coincidence, and quite explainable,
her pride was piqued and her affection
wounded.
</p>

<p>
Still more were they piqued and
wounded when, some days after, as she was
seated in the carriage at the door of a
shop in which Lady Aberfeldie was giving
some orders, she saw this girl loitering in
the same spot, looking anxiously around
her, as if waiting for some one who did not
come, and whom Eveline's heart foreboded
could only be Evan Cameron!
</p>

<p>
She snatched from the carriage-basket
or reticule a lorgnette, through which she
could see that the girl was more than
pretty, very pale, and though plainly yet
fashionably dressed, with an undoubtedly
ladylike air and bearing.
</p>

<p>
If he was Evan she waited for, he did not
keep his appointment, for, after a time, the
stranger turned sadly, lingeringly away,
and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
A dancing-man, a popular young fellow
like Evan Cameron, in one of the most
popular of Scottish regiments, could not
fail to have many lady friends in Edinburgh;
but to have been seen twice in the
same place, with the same girl, at the same
time, and apparently expected there a
<i>third</i> time, was a little peculiar, and apt
to cause Eveline to speculate upon it
unpleasantly.
</p>

<p>
Was this companionship a matter of
daily occurrence?  Or was he, amid the
enforced separation from herself,
beginning to replace her image by another
already&mdash;already?
</p>

<p>
The tenderness of their last meeting, in
the bay-window at Maviswood, seemed to
preclude this cruel idea, and to the hope
that tenderness inspired, she clung most
lovingly; thus, as yet, she did not speak
of the matter to her cousin Olive,
who&mdash;full of her own love-affair and her
new-found happiness&mdash;might not have
sympathised with her as once she would have
done; and, to add to her trouble, in a
little time she would have her old admirer
beside her again, as the member for
Slough-cum-Sloggit was making arrangements
to pair off with another, and would
soon be able to leave London.
</p>

<p>
However, some happiness was in store
for her still.
</p>

<p>
Cameron, to do him justice, spent too
much of his spare time in hovering about
the vicinity of Maviswood not to be
rewarded.  Thus, one clear, bright afternoon,
in a lovely and lonely green lane, where
the holly hedges grew close and darkly,
where the wood violets spread their velvet
leaves on the sunny banks, and where the
mavis and merle sang, they suddenly met
each other, as he came walking slowly
along on foot, leading his horse by the
bridle, which was flung over his arm.
</p>

<p>
His heart was so full of her that, when
he met her suddenly face to face thus, he
scarcely evinced surprise, while tremulously
she put both her hands into
his.
</p>

<p>
'Evan!'
</p>

<p>
'My darling&mdash;at last&mdash;at last!'
</p>

<p>
No eye was upon them there as his
arms went round her, and in the great joy
of seeing him, of meeting him thus, the two
occasions on which she had seen him with
another, promenading slowly under the
trees in Princes Street, were forgotten
and committed to oblivion; though ere
long they were to be roughly brought to
her memory.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Evan&mdash;such long looked-for&mdash;such
unexpected joy!' she exclaimed, as hand
in hand they gazed into each other's
eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Joy indeed, my own one.  I had begun
to fear we might never meet again; and I
shall not leave you now but with the
assurance that we shall meet as often as
we can till&mdash;till&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'When, Evan?'
</p>

<p>
'The regiment marches&mdash;marches for
the East, as it is sure to do before long.
Eveline, you must be out in the garden, in
the grounds often; can I not meet you
there or here again?'
</p>

<p>
She shook her head sadly, and looked at
him lovingly and imploringly.
</p>

<p>
'The meetings in secret&mdash;without
permission&mdash;would be wrong, Evan,' said
she.
</p>

<p>
'Permission&mdash;who will give it?  Whom&mdash;what
have we to consult but our own
hearts?' he continued, passionately.  'We
may have but little time&mdash;less than we
reckon on now&mdash;for the interchange of love
and joy, my dear one; and meet me you
shall&mdash;you <i>must</i>,' he added, as he folded
her to his breast and covered her sweet
passive face with kisses, while something
of hostility and defiance at her whole
family and at Sir Paget welled up in his
heart.  'You will meet me again?' he
urged.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' she replied, in a scarcely audible
whisper.
</p>

<p>
It could be no sin, no crime&mdash;if an
error&mdash;to meet one who loved her so well as
Evan did, and whom she loved so dearly
too.  It could not harm her elderly adorer,
from whose image just then she shrank
with intense loathing; and, if it was a
wrong against her parents, surely they
were in error to coerce her, she thought.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the temptation was
great; the joy of meeting Evan would end
sadly and bitterly when, as he said, the
regiment departed, and after that they
might never see each other more!
</p>

<p>
'Stolen waters are sweet, and bread
eaten in secret is pleasant,' say the
Scriptures; and not less sweet and pleasant were
the interviews that might be stolen thus
in a green and lonely lane.
</p>

<p>
'God help me and direct me!' thought
the girl, as she nestled her face in
Cameron's neck, and, yielding to the natural
impulses of her own heart, promised to
meet him again and again, when time and
opportunity served; and they did so in the
lane between the holly hedges, by the
rural woodland road that deep between
the hills, leads to Ravelston Quarry and
haunted Craigcrook; and at times near
the old church, where the buried Forresters
lie under their altar tombs with shield on
arm and sword at side; and as the days
went on each meeting&mdash;as it seemed to
take place without suspicion or discovery&mdash;served
to cement their hearts together
more and more.
</p>

<p>
But once, when Evan was riding home
in the dusk in the vicinity of Maviswood,
he passed a wayfarer afoot, in whose face
he thought he recognised&mdash;nay, was certain
he saw&mdash;the features of Holcroft.
</p>

<p>
'Holcroft!' thought Evan; 'a man to
guard against, by Jove.  What can <i>he</i> be
about in this neighbourhood&mdash;what but
mischief?'
</p>

<p>
He wheeled his horse round, but the
man he had seen, had stepped over a stile
and disappeared.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
'ALICE!'
</h3>

<p>
My Lady Aberfeldie was all unconscious
of the little romance that had been going
on for some weeks past in the green lanes
and wooded paths near Maviswood; while
Eveline seemed now but to live for the
purpose of meeting Evan Cameron, and
her loving heart and busy little head were
full of cunning schemes and contrivances
to escape detection and achieve their
meetings, which now seemed to make the whole
sense of her existence; and when not with
Evan, or if they failed (which was seldom)
to see each other, even for a few minutes,
her manner became abstracted and triste.
</p>

<p>
But a rude awakening from her joyous
dreams was at hand, and certain past
events that seemed trivial in themselves
were doomed to be recalled to her with a
new and terrible significance!
</p>

<p>
They had one more than usually tender
meeting and tender parting, because Sir
Paget Puddicombe&mdash;the <i>b√™te noir</i>, the
bugbear of both&mdash;was certainly coming
to Maviswood, and Eveline was weeping
bitterly.
</p>

<p>
'Take courage&mdash;take courage, my darling,'
said Evan, as he kissed the tears
from her eyes and strained her to his
breast before he leaped on his horse; 'for
my sake and your own have strength to
resist, and all may yet be well&mdash;for my
sake and your own, dearest Alice,' he
added, with quivering lips, and was gone.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Alice!</i>'
</p>

<p>
Another's name uttered by his lips
involuntarily while his heart seemed to be
teeming with tenderness for herself&mdash;uttered
in that moment of supreme sorrow,
passion, and endearment&mdash;escaped him
mechanically, as it were, yet too evidently
by use and wont!
</p>

<p>
What did it mean&mdash;what could it mean,
but one thing?
</p>

<p>
Her heart stood still for a moment and
then beat wildly; she did not hear the
noise of his horse's hoofs dying away in
the distance, nor did she see his lessening
figure, for the powers of hearing and of
vision seemed to fail her.
</p>

<p>
She had received a cruel and terrible
shock.  Had she heard aright, or was it
all a delusion of her ear, yet she repeated
to herself with pallid face and quivering
lips the word 'Alice!' while memory flashed
back to the girl she had seen thrice&mdash;twice
with Evan, and once evidently waiting
for him at what seemed their trysting-place.
</p>

<p>
She remembered that the second time
she had seen them they were walking
silently together&mdash;full of their own
thoughts apparently&mdash;and making no
effort to entertain each other, and she had
read that it is only 'the nearest and
dearest' of kinships&mdash;the closest and sweetest
of human intimacies that could explain
such "wordless proximity."  Strangers,
acquaintances, when thrown together <i>must</i>
politely talk; brother and sister, husband
and wife, may be confidently, blessedly
silent!'
</p>

<p>
She remembered now, with ready suspicion,
that, when she and Evan first met
suddenly afterwards, he scarcely evinced
surprise.  We have said that it was
because his heart was full of her image, but
this idea, this hope, did not occur to
Eveline then&mdash;her mind was a chaos.
</p>

<p>
How she got through the remainder of
that day she never knew; she had but one
wish: to shun her mother's eye.  To
seclude herself in her own room would
attract attention; thus she remained in the
drawing-room and affected to read.  She
opened a book at the page and point
where she had last left off.
</p>

<p>
Alas! it was beyond the power of books
to soothe or win her from herself now.
The Lethean power of the novelist had
departed, and her whole mind seemed out
of tune.
</p>

<p>
She threw aside the volume and took up
another, but a cry escaped her as it fell
from her hands.  It was Bulwer's 'Alice,
or the Mysteries;' the name seemed to
enter her heart like a knife, and she rushed
away to her room.
</p>

<p>
The dressing-bell for dinner, when it
rang, found her very pale, and wrestling,
as it were, with a strange and unusual
pain that was eating its way into her
heart.
</p>

<p>
She bathed her face again and again,
but failed to hide the dark shadows under
her eyes or the inflammation of their
delicate lids.
</p>

<p>
And at dinner-time that evening an
additional stab was given to her in the most
casual and unexpected way.  Her father
had brought from his club to Maviswood
Carslogie of the Black Watch, a heedless
and thoughtless young fellow, of whom
she overheard Allan making some inquiries
concerning Cameron of Stratherroch.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Strath is jolly as a sandboy,' replied
Carslogie, 'but he has some mysterious
affair of the heart on just now.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'In the usual way.  There is a pretty
girl he goes about with to all public places,
but introduces to no one.  She is without
a chaperone, and no one knows whether
she is maid, wife, or widow; funny, by
Jove, isn't it?'
</p>

<p>
Carslogie said this in a low voice to
Allan, yet not so low but that it reached
the ears of Eveline, who had some difficulty
in concealing her agitation.
</p>

<p>
With instinctive tenderness Allan glanced
at his sister and skilfully changed the
subject to the then invariable topic of
Arabi Pasha and 'the coming row in
Egypt.'
</p>

<p>
Times there were when she had thought
that she would condescend to go once
again to their trysting-place, and seek an
explanation; but now, after what Carslogie
had said, wild horses should not drag her
there!
</p>

<p>
She would never upbraid Evan with his
baseness, never more would she go there;
she would simply tear his image out of her
heart, and let the matter end.  But this
was easier to say than to achieve.
</p>

<p>
Her soul seemed to have become numbed
within her&mdash;frozen, if we may use such
terms.
</p>

<p>
Even in the matter of Sir Paget, she
was conscious now of feeling neither
repugnance nor ridicule, though she felt a
little repentance at her opposition to the
wishes of her father and mother, and for
the duplicity of which she had been guilty
towards them in her love for an unworthy
object, and meeting him in secret, as if
she had been a sewing-girl or waiting-maid,
and not the daughter of a peer, and
putting herself, perhaps, in an equivocal
position.
</p>

<p>
She confided in Olive; otherwise her
heart, she thought, would burst.
</p>

<p>
'The heart is said to be "deceitful above
all things, and desperately wicked,"' said
Olive, 'but I must confess that this affair
passes my comprehension.  He cannot be
in love with <i>two</i> at once; yet I have read
of such things.  Forget him; you must do
that&mdash;at least.  You endure too much,
Eveline; you believed in him too much, and,
I fear, hoped too much.  Even friendship
has its limits; how much more so love.'
</p>

<p>
'And but yesterday I was so happy&mdash;happy
in a love the end of which I could
not foresee!' wailed poor Eveline, on her
cousin's bosom.
</p>

<p>
What was she like, this Alice?  Her
rival&mdash;oh, disgrace!  Fair or dark&mdash;she
remembered that she was pale and pretty.
But what did it matter, thought the now
crushed girl, as she tossed feverishly on
her pillow in the gloom and solitude of the
night, when even our thoughts seem to
assume distinct outlines that become sharp
and vivid.
</p>

<p>
Night had passed&mdash;a new day dawned,
and how far, far off seemed yesterday!
The sun had risen in his glory; the blackbirds
were singing in the dew-laden shrubberies
of Maviswood; and the pale mists
were clearing off Torduff and Kirkyetton
Craig, the highest summits of the lovely
Pentlands.
</p>

<p>
It was late ere Eveline had wept herself
to sleep; but to her it seemed as if she had
not slept at all.  Thus it was proportionately
late when she awoke heavily to the
morning of a new day.
</p>

<p>
She had given her whole soul with joy
to her hopeless love for Evan&mdash;hopeless,
but pure&mdash;though any happy end to it she
could not foresee; but this was a bitter
collapse she did not anticipate, and now
her 'occupation was gone.'
</p>

<p>
Was she the same Eveline Graham who
but yesterday morning shook off sleep so
lightly, and rose fresh, strong, and full of
hope, with the conviction that her secret
lover was true to her and to this hopeless
passion?
</p>

<p>
Her affectionate heart was crushed; her
self-esteem was in the dust; her proud head
lay low indeed; and for the first time in
her young life she had learned what it is to
be cut to the soul&mdash;to be completely humbled.
</p>

<p>
And Alice&mdash;who and what was <i>she</i>?
</p>

<p>
'And oh, Olive, how am I to meet
mamma?' was the first exclamation after
they had got rid of Mademoiselle Clairette.
</p>

<p>
She knew she would have to join in the
conversation of the breakfast-table, when
all her vigilance would be requisite to
prevent her from pit-falls of suspicious silence
or confusion of manner, with the helpless
air and uncertain voice of one who seeks
to conceal a new and hitherto unknown
sorrow: and to undergo, with her sad,
white, humiliated face, her mother's critical
and observant eyes.
</p>

<p>
If, in desperation, she did not act a part,
that watchful mother would be sure to
detect a change, and that there was
something wrong.
</p>

<p>
Eveline knew well that she would soon
detect every flicker of her eyelashes, every
tremor of the heavy white lids, that would
droop in spite of her now; but luckily
Lady Aberfeldie was busy in her boudoir
with the housekeeper and Mr. Tappleton,
the butler, giving orders; for Sir Paget
Puddicombe would arrive ere long!
</p>

<p>
Carslogie had gone back to Edinburgh,
of course, last night.  He would be with
Evan Cameron this morning on parade and
so forth; would the latter question him
about his visit to Maviswood, about <i>her</i>
perhaps?  But what did it matter now
whether he did so or did not?
Nothing&mdash;less than nothing!
</p>

<p>
How long the hours seemed now when
they were empty&mdash;<i>quite</i> empty of all but
bitterness.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile days passed on, and Cameron
came, as was his wont, to the usual places
of meeting, but Eveline was never there.
</p>

<p>
What had happened&mdash;how was she detained?
Had an illness come upon her?
His mind was a prey to the keenest anxiety,
which he was without the means of allaying.
He could not write to ask for any
explanation, neither could he call at
Maviswood after the somewhat studied coldness
of his last reception there by her father
and mother.
</p>

<p>
At each place and spot where so lately
they had met and wandered, the thoughts
that found utterance there, and many a
tender caress came potently and poignantly
back to memory now.  Where was she,
what doing, how engaged and with whom&mdash;in
sickness or in health?&mdash;he asked of
himself with endless iteration.
</p>

<p>
Trivialities are often associated with the
greatest eventualities in our lives.  Thus
long in the memory of Evan would his last
visit to one of these beloved spots be
associated with the shrill notes of a mavis
perched upon the topmost bough of a tree.
</p>

<p>
Ignorant as yet of what he himself had
done, ignorant also of the mischief his
friend Carslogie had unintentionally done
him by retailing some mess-room gossip,
in the vagueness of his thoughts and ideas
of the whole situation, which we shall
ere-long unravel, Cameron was inclined to
attribute the total cessation of Eveline's
meetings with him to some mysterious
influence of Hawke Holcroft&mdash;if Holcroft it
was whom he saw in the dusk.
</p>

<p>
From Carslogie he learned that 'she
was looking well and jolly,' as he phrased
it.  When Allan rejoined he would hear
more of her, he hoped; but Allan's sick
leave was protracted from time to time,
and none seemed to know <i>when</i> he would
be with the regiment again.
</p>

<p>
Once these parted lovers saw each other
but for a moment only!
</p>

<p>
Accompanied by a groom, Eveline rode
at a canter past him on a lonely part of
the road near Maviswood, her eyes full of
unshed tears, her face pale with
resentment, and her veil in her teeth.
</p>

<p>
Past him, as if he was a stranger!
</p>

<p>
'Why stop to speak or expect an
explanation?' thought the girl.  'In this
world do not actions speak louder a
thousand times than words can ever do?'
</p>

<p>
She was a Graham of Dundargue, and
would show him that she was not of the
kind of stuff that facile Amelias or patient
Griseldas are made!
</p>

<p>
Yet to pass him by thus, cost her a
mighty effort, though to Eveline it seemed
that there was nothing left for her now
'but to wrestle valiantly with that pain
which, in the world's eye, degrades the
woman who smarts under it&mdash;the pain of
an unshared love.'

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
'THE MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO.'
</h3>

<p>
'Young Stratherroch seems to have
accepted the situation.  He is much too
sharp and well-bred a man not to have
seen that he was&mdash;well&mdash;in the way rather,'
said Lady Aberfeldie to her husband one
afternoon.  'One thing is certain at least,
he has ceased to visit here.'
</p>

<p>
'Dropped out of the hunt&mdash;yes,' assented
the peer, as he filled and lit his briar-root.
'Poor fellow! he was&mdash;or is&mdash;undoubtedly
fond of our little girl.'
</p>

<p>
'Such fondness was folly in one so
poor; and now, as Sir Paget comes to-day,
I do not see why we should not have the
two marriages at once.  I am most
anxious to have all this fuss ended and done
with.'
</p>

<p>
'There are several deeds to draw and
so forth in the matter of Allan and Olive;
and as for Eveline she has not yet consented.'
</p>

<p>
'She must do so now, I presume,' said
Lady Aberfeldie, impatiently wafting aside
with her white hand a cloud of smoke the
peer was creating.
</p>

<p>
'Both marriages,' said he, reflectively;
'but how if the regiment goes on foreign
service&mdash;and the corps expects orders of
readiness daily, I understand?'
</p>

<p>
'Allan can send in his papers.'
</p>

<p>
'Impossible!  You do not consider
what you say.'
</p>

<p>
'He is not well enough to go abroad.'
</p>

<p>
'He is too well to remain behind; and
if well enough to marry I fear that
F.M. the Commander-in-Chief will deem him
well enough to march.'
</p>

<p>
'Anyway it will secure Olive's fortune
in the family.'
</p>

<p>
'It is secured as it is by her father's
will so long as Allan is willing to consent;
but as our loving daughter-in-law, there
will be no necessity for the enforcement of
the clause that is so grotesque.  As
regards Sir Paget and Eveline&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Leave me to manage Eveline,' said
Lady Aberfeldie, bluntly and loftily.
</p>

<p>
The result of her management was soon
apparent, though she knew not that
circumstances, of which she was as yet
unaware, were playing into her hands, and
would yet more completely do so.
</p>

<p>
'Sir Paget, as you know, Eveline, will
be here to-day,' said she, with an arm
round her daughter's neck, 'and we&mdash;that
is, your papa and I&mdash;trust, child, that you
will receive him as you ought, and wear
the jewels he sent you.'
</p>

<p>
Lady Aberfeldie used her softest yet
firmest voice as she spoke to Eveline, but
it sounded to the latter as the voice of
one who was a long, long way off.
</p>

<p>
She made no immediate reply; but with
her hands tightly interlaced, as if thereby
she would quell emotion, seemed to be
gazing down at her nicely pointed little
foot that rested on a velvet fender-stool.
</p>

<p>
'Why mope here, growing pale and
thin, for a thing without substance&mdash;a
dream&mdash;a shadow, Eveline; you understand me?'
</p>

<p>
'A dream&mdash;a shadow, indeed, mamma!'
</p>

<p>
'You hear me, child?' said her mother.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, mamma,' replied Eveline, who
seemed to shiver with cold as her mother
left her, but with a long backward glance
that had more of menace than entreaty
in it.
</p>

<p>
'He never loved me,' Eveline was
thinking.  'I have given my heart for
nothing, and am now cast aside for
another, like a broken toy discarded by a
child.  He dared to trifle with me&mdash;my
father's daughter!  It is clear now that
he fancied, or merely pretended to be in
love with me, while all the time his heart
was given to&mdash;<i>Alice</i>!'
</p>

<p>
And she would have been either more
or less than human, if with her just
indignation there did not mingle a certain
sentiment of revenge that bore her up in the
part she meant to act now; though she
shrank as yet from the conviction that,
when esteem dies, love dies with it.
</p>

<p>
So that evening Eveline wore the suite
of jewels&mdash;such jewels as Bond Street
alone can furnish&mdash;and Sir Paget, as he
sat by her side, jerked his little bald head
about, in the exuberance of joy, and in a
way that was really alarming.
</p>

<p>
Olive was looking radiantly beautiful,
in a brilliant dinner costume, with Allan's
Maltese suite of diamonds and pearls
sparkling on her neck and arms, which
Lady Aberfeldie had urged her to don in
honour of Sir Paget, and in defiance of a
<i>moue</i> and pitiful glance of Eveline, who
had no small difficulty in acquitting
herself at dinner in her new role of <i>fianc√©e</i>,
but nearly broke down when she heard
Sir Paget raise his voice and say to her
father something that he was not sorry he
might say with a clear conscience, and as
a matter-of-fact.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, by the way, Aberfeldie, when I
arrived at the rail way-station this morning
I witnessed a very tender leave-taking
between a young friend of yours and a
most charming girl&mdash;gad, the fellow has
taste&mdash;a girl whom he was seeing off,
to London, I presume, by the Flying
Scotsman, it was quite pathetic, by
Jove!'
</p>

<p>
'A young friend of ours&mdash;who do you
mean, Sir Paget?' asked Lady Aberfeldie.
</p>

<p>
'Cameron, of the Black Watch, whom I
had the pleasure of meeting at Dundargue&mdash;you
remember,' said Sir Paget, playing
with the stem of his champagne-glass,
and not daring to look at Eveline, whose
white hand he saw trembling as she toyed
with her grapes.
</p>

<p>
'Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;indeed&mdash;and the young
lady&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Had "Mrs. Cameron" painted on all
her luggage&mdash;great Indian overlands, some
of it.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Mrs. Cameron</i>,' repeated Lady Aberfeldie,
whose aristocratic face shone in spite
of herself at these tidings, while Lord
Aberfeldie looked flushed and perplexed,
and like Allan, who pitied his poor sister,
remained silent.
</p>

<p>
This astounding intelligence was to poor
Eveline as 'the last straw' to the
over-laden camel; she betrayed no outward
emotion, though her heart and spirit were
completely broken down, for a phase of
duplicity which she could never have
conceived was now suddenly laid bare to
her.
</p>

<p>
When, with her aunt and cousin, she
retired to the drawing-room, the latter
pressed her hand affectionately and caressingly,
while the former, too proud or too
prudent to refer to what they had just
heard so greatly to her satisfaction, sat in
a shady corner and slowly fanned herself
in silence with a great round feather
fan.
</p>

<p>
An emotion of jealous spite at young
Cameron, with rivalry, passion, and
ambition to possess a young, beautiful, and
highly-born wife, all now inspired Sir
Paget, who, to do him justice in the
anecdote he had told, had told no more than
the truth, and, for the happiness of Evan
Cameron, we are sorry to say it.
</p>

<p>
But though now permitting herself
quietly to drift with the stream of events,
and to become a tool in the hands of
others, it was impossible for Eveline, when
with Sir Paget in the grounds, or when
alone in the drawing-room, not to shrink
from his now privileged caresses and
attentions; thus once she shocked him by
saying, as she withdrew her hands from
his clasp,
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Sir Paget, do you really mean to
marry a woman who does not and never
can love you?'
</p>

<p>
'Do not say "never can."  How can we
know what the future may have for
me&mdash;for <i>us</i>, my dear girl?'
</p>

<p>
'Who, indeed, save One!' sighed the
girl, wearily.
</p>

<p>
'I would rather have half your heart
than the whole of any other woman's,' said
Sir Paget, gallantly, while recapturing her
hands, and jerking out his head in turtle
fashion.
</p>

<p>
'My whole heart,' thought Eveline, 'is&mdash;oh,
no&mdash;was full of Evan, but can have
no vacant corner for any other, especially
such a man as this.'
</p>

<p>
And even while she thought this she
shivered as if with cold, when in right of
his new position he caressed her.
</p>

<p>
'How, with all their innate pride, papa
and mamma are content to abandon me to
this absurd little man Puddicombe, as they
do, passes my comprehension,' said she to
Olive.  'Puddicombe&mdash;such an absurd
name too,' she added, with a little laugh
that was hysterical; 'and what object can
the splendour of his settlements be to
them?  They seem to ignore the fact that
the Grahams of Dundargue were barons of
the Scottish Parliament when the ancestors
of half the British peerage were hewers of
wood and drawers of water&mdash;peasantry
and artisans!'
</p>

<p>
So in the bloom of her youth and
beauty, the time 'when the light that
surrounds us is all from within,' Eveline
Graham was to become a victim at the
altar after all&mdash;after all!
</p>

<p>
And Cameron seemed to have prepared
the path for her, for, stunned by his too
apparent duplicity, she schooled herself for
the <i>r√¥le</i> of indifference to fate; but this
was chiefly by day, for often at night she
would lie where she had thrown herself,
across her bed, forgetting even to undress,
her tear-blotted face covered by her soft
arm, and so in the morning the wondering
and sympathising Clairette would find
her.
</p>

<p>
June was creeping on now, with its
sunny, fragrant breath; there were white
and purple blossoms in the parterres of
the garden; the graceful laburnums were
dropping their golden petals in showers
over the rosebuds and green lawns that
were bordered by dark shining myrtles
and deep-tinted laurels and rhododendrons.
</p>

<p>
From the fields came the rasping sound
made by the mower as he whetted his
scythe, before which the rich feathered
grass and the wild flowers are done to
death; elsewhere the joyous haymakers
were hard at work, and the dust of June
began to roll along the roads before the
wind in the sunshine.
</p>

<p>
'June!' thought Eveline.  'Where will
the winter find me?'
</p>

<p>
The preparations for her marriage were
hurried on with a rapidity that appalled
her; but, dear as the scheme was to Lady
Aberfeldie, a somewhat unexpected event
delayed that of Allan and Olive Raymond,
and gave the Aberfeldie family once more
something else to think of.
</p>

<p>
One evening when all the others were in
Edinburgh save himself and Olive&mdash;for
Eveline's forthcoming marriage kept all
rather busy now&mdash;Allan, full of his own
happy thoughts, and the joy that would be
his ere long, was smoking in the grounds,
when he was startled by a shrill cry that
proceeded from an open window of the
house&mdash;a French window that opened to
the ground&mdash;and swift as light a man
dashed past him and disappeared among
the thick shrubberies.
</p>

<p>
'A thief!' was Allan's first thought;
'but whose cry was that?' was his second.
</p>

<p>
The face of the intruder, who passed
near him&mdash;a pale and familiar one, seen
just as Cameron had before seen it&mdash;seemed
to be that of Hawke Holcroft.
</p>

<p>
'Impossible,' thought Allan, as he hurried
towards the house; but it was not until
he had further proofs that he became aware
that the face he had seen&mdash;the face of
ill-omen&mdash;was that of Holcroft!
</p>

<p>
He hurried into the apartment through
the open window, and was horrified to find
Olive prostrate on the floor, with her arms
outspread, and in a fainting condition.
He raised her up and laid her on a sofa,
withdrawing the pillow from under her
head, and looked round for water to lave
her face and hands, one of which clutched
a pen.
</p>

<p>
A large sealskin cigar case, with Rio
Hondo cigars in it&mdash;a case which he well
remembered to have seen in possession of
Holcroft&mdash;lay upon the floor.
</p>

<p>
How came it there, unless the man he
saw was, beyond all doubt, Hawke Holcroft?
</p>

<p>
Olive's cheque-book&mdash;for she had a bank
account of her own&mdash;lay open on her
davenport, and Allan's eye caught the
counterfoil of one, dated that very day, and
almost wet still, for ¬£400.
</p>

<p>
'Four hundred pounds!' he gasped, and
tried to tear open his necktie, while the
room swam round him.  'Oh, God! can it
be that she is playing fast and loose with
me and that double-dyed villain?'
</p>

<p>
That she should have any intercourse,
verbal or written, with such a wretch
excited in Allan a gust of rage and bewilderment,
disgust, horror, and intense perplexity.
</p>

<p>
Yet it might be all quite explainable&mdash;even
the cheque.
</p>

<p>
She opened her eyes and closed them
again, and pathetically he besought her to
tell him what had happened, but could
elicit no reply.  Her slender throat seemed
parched, as she failed to articulate.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Olive,' said he, 'if I alarm you,
forgive me.  You know how I love you.
Why torture me by this silence&mdash;tell me
all&mdash;<i>what</i> has happened&mdash;<i>who</i> has been
here?'
</p>

<p>
But he urged and pled in vain; her teeth
were clenched.
</p>

<p>
'Is it some folly&mdash;some girlish imprudence? <i>what</i>
is it?  Dear love, only tell me?'
</p>

<p>
Still she was silent, and Allan's brows
knit darkly and ominously, while, in the
excited state of his nerves, he felt sharp
twinges in the arm that had been fractured,
and, when consciousness came partially
back to Olive, she covered her face with
her hands, and sobbed heavily and spasmodically.
</p>

<p>
What had happened?  Why was she so
suddenly cast down, hurled, as it were,
from the joy, rapture, and repose of an
hour ago, to the apparent agony and shame
of the present?
</p>

<p>
Nothing could be elicited from her, and
the next day found her in a species of
hysterical fever, and in the hands of the
doctor.
</p>

<p>
In a short time it was discovered that
her cheque&mdash;an open one&mdash;payable to
Mr. Hawke Holcroft, and duly endorsed by
that personage, had been presented and
cashed at a bank; yet no explanation could
be elicited from her about it.
</p>

<p>
'She had on the ill-omened diamonds,
mother,' said Allan, interrogatively.  'How
was this?'
</p>

<p>
'I lent them to her, as the bride of the
house, and doubtless she had been trying
them on when&mdash;when&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'This scoundrel thrust himself upon her
presence?'
</p>

<p>
'I suppose so,' said Lady Aberfeldie,
weeping.
</p>

<p>
'Evil always comes of these accursed
stones!'
</p>

<p>
'It is simply outrageous,' said Lord
Aberfeldie, sternly and loftily, 'that even
the family of the most humble tradesman
should be haunted by a Frankenstein&mdash;a
swindler, and worse, like this&mdash;but that a
house like mine&mdash;the house of a peer of
the realm&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
And his lordship in his indignation
paused as utterance failed him.
</p>

<p>
'Mystery is involved here,' exclaimed
Lady Aberfeldie, 'and I dislike it intensely,
as vulgar and very bad style.'
</p>

<p>
'By Jove, I should think so,' added
Allan, gloomily; 'but this affair, like
Cameron's marriage, beats the mysteries
of Udolpho!'
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
'GUP,' AND WHAT CAME OF IT,
</h3>

<p>
And now, ere it is too late, to let a little
light on what must seem a mystery, and to
tell a story which Eveline was not to hear
until the fatal die was cast.
</p>

<p>
'Dear Evan,' said a handsome girl, as
she interlaced her slender fingers on
Cameron's arm lovingly in one of the most
secluded walks of the Princes-Street
Gardens, and under the shadow of the
towering castle rock, 'I cannot bear to see you
looking so unhappy&mdash;what <i>is</i> the matter?'
</p>

<p>
'Eveline Graham has ceased to meet
me.  She is ill&mdash;or&mdash;or I know not what!'
</p>

<p>
'Cannot you ascertain?'
</p>

<p>
'No.  I have no means of ascertaining;
moreover, only the other day she cut me.'
</p>

<p>
'Cut you&mdash;passed you?'
</p>

<p>
'Cut me dead!'
</p>

<p>
'Surely that was bad in taste.'
</p>

<p>
'And cruel too&mdash;so unlike her, Alice
darling, that I know not what to think.'
</p>

<p>
'She has resolved to accept her rich old
baronet&mdash;that is all; and I shall hear all
about it when I am far away from you in
India.  How strange,' added the girl,
dreamily, while a great, yet pensive, joy
lighted up her blue eyes, 'how strange to
think that I am still in Edinburgh, and so
far away from <i>him</i>, when there was a time
when I wondered if anyone in this world
was ever so happy as I, when dear stupid
Duncan asked me to be his wife!  And oh,
Evan dear, but for you and your great
kindness to us, my heart must have broken
and I should never have seen Duncan
more!'
</p>

<p>
The fair speaker was the Alice whose
name had unconsciously escaped Evan, as
his heart was full of a great love and pity
for her&mdash;the wife of his younger brother
Duncan, from whom she had been separated
in consequence of a foolish jealous
quarrel, and having been, through that,
sent home by him from India, had no other
friend in Europe to whom to turn for
succour and support than the kind-hearted,
but half-penniless Laird of Stratherroch,
who had at last effected an explanation
and reconciliation between them.
</p>

<p>
When quartered in cantonments, in the
first year of their marriage, not far from
Hurdwar on the Ganges (where Allan got
the idol he gave to Olive) there seemed to
be no more loving and attached couple
than Duncan Cameron and his little wife
Alice, and both were prime favourites
with the garrison; he, for his fine bearing
which made him the pattern officer of his
regiment&mdash;a Bengal Infantry corps&mdash;his
skill in horsemanship, as a marksman and
pigsticker, and his general <i>bonhomie</i> and
good nature.  She, for her beauty and
sweetness, her great abundance of animal
spirits, and a charming <i>espi√®glerie</i> that
made her the object of attention from all.
</p>

<p>
Ladies were scarce in these cantonments
so far 'up country,' and thus Alice proved a
wonderful attraction to all the young subs
at the band-stand, or on the racecourse,
and elsewhere; and they hovered about
her rather more than Duncan Cameron
quite relished.
</p>

<p>
She was a leading feature at all the
entertainments given by Sir Bevis Batardeau,
G.C.S.I., the brigadier, and his wife; and
indeed no ball, picnic, or dance was
deemed complete without the presence of Alice
Cameron.
</p>

<p>
Now, Sir Bevis was a notorious old <i>rou√©</i>,
and the cause of much 'gup,' as scandal
or gossip is called in India.  He was a
middle-aged man of fashion, grizzled and
rather bald, with a reddish nose and
wicked eyes, while Lady Batardeau, his senior
by a year or two, was a kind and motherly
woman, who loved Alice dearly; and 'gup'
of course asserted that the General did so
too, in a fashion of his own, and many
things were said that never reached as yet
the ears of Duncan Cameron.
</p>

<p>
The latter was sent to some distance
from the cantonments on a particular duty,
and poor Alice was left to mope in her
bungalow alone.
</p>

<p>
'I often thought,' she said, 'if anything
should ever separate us, I would die.  The
fear smote me like a sword's point, Evan,
and the night Duncan left me a jackal
howled fearfully in the compound.  Was
it ominous of evil?  I fear so&mdash;for
separated terribly we were fated to be, through
no fault of mine.'
</p>

<p>
These forebodings made her pass sleeplessly
the hot and breathless Indian nights
while hourly the cantonment <i>ghurries</i> were
clanged, and the jackals howled in the
prickly hedges, and the mosquitoes seemed
a thousand times more annoying&mdash;no
chowrie would whisk them out of the
muslin curtains; and her breakfast seemed so
insipid now, and Gunga Ram, the <i>khansa-man</i>,
or native butler, could find nothing
to tempt her appetite; yet Gunga, though,
like most Hindostanees, doubtful of the
virtue of every European woman, was
devoted to his own particular <i>mehm Sahib</i>.
</p>

<p>
Every morning she had been wont to
watch at the open Venetian blinds of their
bungalow for the handsome figure of
Duncan returning from the early parade, while
the sun was yet on the verge of the
horizon; and every evening was spent together
in delicious idleness&mdash;riding on the
course, promenading by the band-stand,
or wandering among the groves where the
baubool breathes an exquisite perfume
from its bells of gold, as the oleander
does from its clusters of pink and white
blossoms, and where the lovely little
tailor-bird sews two leaves together and swings
in his sweet-scented nest from the bough
of some little tree.
</p>

<p>
Hourly she longed for the return of
Duncan.
</p>

<p>
She was a petted favourite with Lady
Batardeau, who, when calling on her one
day, found her asleep under the verandah
outside Cameron's bungalow on a long low
Indian arm-chair.
</p>

<p>
Thinking how charming the girl-wife
looked, Lady Batardeau, in playful kindness,
slipped on one of her fingers a
rose-diamond ring, which had been in the past
time a gift to herself from Sir Bevis, when
she valued his gifts more than she had
reason to do now; and, having done this,
she went softly and laughingly away.
</p>

<p>
To the joy of Alice, Cameron returned
suddenly while she was yet puzzling
herself to account for the presence of the
ring, and for a time, in the happiness of
their reunion, she forgot all about it, till
he, while toying with her pretty hands,
observed it on her finder.
</p>

<p>
'A magnificent ring, Alice,' said he.
'Where did it come from?'
</p>

<p>
'That is more than I can tell you.'
</p>

<p>
'How?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'I found that it had been slipped on
my finger when I was asleep.'
</p>

<p>
'By whom?'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot say, Duncan dear.'
</p>

<p>
On examining the jewel he saw graven
on the inside the name of that notorious
old <i>rou√©</i> and Lothario, the brigadier!
</p>

<p>
Lady Batardeau had left the cantonments
for awhile, and poor Alice could
give no explanation as to how the
mysterious ring with the name of Sir Bevis
thereon came to be on her finger.  Duncan
loved her so trustfully, so utterly, that
doubt failed for a time to find a place in
his gallant heart; but 'gup' had playfully
asserted that the old brigadier immensely
admired young Mrs. Cameron&mdash;he recalled
some jests he had heard, and now the
poison they breathed was stealing upon
his senses, and his face grew white as
death.
</p>

<p>
Duncan mistook the genuine confusion
of Alice for guilt&mdash;her dismay for dread
of detection, and the whole affair for a
feature in an intrigue.  He knew how
keen and bitter was scandal in India,
and already he saw himself a source of
mockery and disgrace, and figuring,
perhaps, in the columns of the <i>Hurkara</i>!
</p>

<p>
He saw it all now!  He had been sent
on duty to a distance for some days, as he
believed out of his turn, and by the
express order of the brigadier.
</p>

<p>
That circumstance had surprised him,
but he believed it was fully explained now
by finding the ring of Sir Bevis on his
wife's finger, and he became transported
with fury.  Alice cowered for a time
beneath the expression she read in his face.
</p>

<p>
Could it be possible, he thought, that
she was proving as one of the 'dead-sea
apples of life, which a mocking fate so
often throws in our lap, charming to the
imagination, but bitter to the sense?'
</p>

<p>
'Duncan!' said Alice, softly and imploringly;
but he felt all the mute despair of
a broken heart, the agony of a shaken
faith, and he put her soft white hands
gently from him, as if he would never
seek them in this life again.
</p>

<p>
He at once sought the presence of the
brigadier, who, on hearing what he had to
say, certainly&mdash;to do him justice&mdash;was
rather bewildered.
</p>

<p>
'I beg leave, sir, to return to you this
ring,' said Duncan, tossing it contemptuously
on the table.
</p>

<p>
'My ring&mdash;my wife's ring it was&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Was</i>&mdash;eh!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Captain Cameron.  Where did
you find it?'
</p>

<p>
'Where you placed it, I doubt
not.'
</p>

<p>
'I do not understand your tone and
manner, Captain Cameron; but I certainly
placed it on the finger&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Of my wife,' said Duncan, hoarsely and
scornfully.  'I thank you for your kind
attention, but trust that it will end here
ere worse come of it.  I am not a man to
be trifled with, Sir Bevis.'
</p>

<p>
Now, Sir Bevis had no dislike to be
thought 'a gay Lothario, a sad dog, and
all that sort of thing,' so he actually
simpered provokingly, shrugged his shoulders
and said, deprecatingly,
</p>

<p>
'Really, you wrong Mrs. Cameron.'
</p>

<p>
'She has deceived me!' exclaimed
Duncan, furiously.
</p>

<p>
'If a woman can't deceive her own
husband, <i>whom</i> may she deceive!' asked
the unwise brigadier.
</p>

<p>
'In the days of the pistol this matter
would not have ended here.'
</p>

<p>
'Come, come, don't let you and I fall to
carte and tierce in this fashion,' said the
general; 'it may be explainable&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I want no explanations!'
</p>

<p>
'As you please.  It seems there is a
little romance in most lives&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'With your grey hairs you should have
outlived all that, I think.'
</p>

<p>
Now his years proved a sore point with
old Sir Bevis, and he became inflamed
with anger; but, ere he could retort,
Duncan had jerked his sword under his left
arm and swept from his presence with a
rather withering expression in his face,
and that very evening saw Alice in the
train for Delhi, <i>en route</i> to Europe.
</p>

<p>
'Innocent, I suffer all the shame and all
the agony of guilt!  Oh, it is hard,
Duncan&mdash;very, very hard,' were the last words
she said, brokenly, to her husband, who
heard her with a stern silence that
astonished her.
</p>

<p>
Now that Lady Batardeau, on her return
to the cantonments, had explained the
whole story of the ring, Duncan was&mdash;when
too late, for his wife was on the sea&mdash;full
of shame and contrition for his
suspicions and severity, and had written to
crave the pardon of Alice and insure her
return to him again; hence the farewell
and departure of 'Mrs. Cameron,' with her
overlands and other baggage, as witnessed
by the sharp little eyes of Sir Paget
Puddicombe at the Waverley Station, and thus it
was that, by an unexplained mistake, two
fond hearts were separated for ever; but
separated they would have been eventually
by fate or fortune&mdash;the lack of fortune,
rather&mdash;as time may show.
</p>

<p>
But for a time poor Eveline had to
ponder bitterly on the humiliating thought
that Evan Cameron had been thinking of
<i>another</i> face, form, and name while in the
act of caressing herself, and that the other
was&mdash;as Sir Paget had left them no reason
to doubt, and never himself doubted&mdash;Evan
Cameron's wife!
</p>

<p><a id="chap12"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
OLIVE'S VISITOR,
</h3>

<p>
Another mystery has now to be accounted
for&mdash;the state in which Allan found Olive
when her cry reached him as he idled with
his cigar in the grounds at Maviswood in
the evening, when the rest of the family
circle were in town.
</p>

<p>
Olive was seated alone in one of the
drawing-rooms when a gentleman was
announced&mdash;a gentleman who no doubt
thought Allan was absent in Edinburgh
also.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Holcroft.'
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Holcroft!'  A book she was reading
fell from the hand of Olive, and she
started to her feet as that personage, hat
in hand, stood smilingly before her.  For
a moment she could scarcely believe her
eyes as they met the pale, watery, and
shifty ones of her unexpected visitor.
</p>

<p>
Terror and horror filled her heart on
finding herself face to face with this
man&mdash;an assassin in intent!  It was too
horrible&mdash;too <i>outr√©</i> and grotesque to think
of.
</p>

<p>
But what was his intention now?  She
was not left long in ignorance.  Why did
she not rush to the bell&mdash;summon the
household, and have the daring intruder
expelled or arrested?  But no&mdash;she felt a
very coward just then, with a great dread
of Allan discovering him, and a heavy,
sickening foreboding of coming evil.
</p>

<p>
There came dreamily to her memory,
too, some threatening words of his when
he had said that he would let no man come
between them, and that, though he might
fail to compel her to love him, he might
compel her to marry him: but neither love
nor marriage were in the mind of her
horrible visitor just then.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hawke Holcroft seemed rather
'down on his luck,' and looked somewhat
shabby and seedy.  The last fragment of
his patrimony had been swallowed up; his
betting-book had proved a mistake, as he
had for some time past backed the wrong
horses; cards had failed him and play of
all kinds; in short, he was desperate, and
hence his appearance at Maviswood.
</p>

<p>
To attempt the role of a lover again,
after all that had passed, and after all that
he was aware must be known to Miss
Raymond, was, he knew, impossible; but he
had a trump card to play in the way of
extortion&mdash;plain, blunt, rascally extortion;
so, conceiving that the girl was utterly
alone, he could not for the life of him
resist bantering her a little, all the more
as the utter loathing and dread her face
expressed, enraged him.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Holcroft!' she exclaimed, in a
breathless voice, as she recoiled and
became white as a lily.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Hawke Holcroft, the man your
fatal beauty has made him,' said he, with
melodramatic gloom and folded arms;
'when I met you first I met my fate&mdash;a
love that was my doom.  But for you,
would I ever have been mad enough to
attempt the life of Allan Graham?'
</p>

<p>
'How dare you come here&mdash;how dare
you speak to me thus!' said Olive, glancing
at the bell handle; but he planted himself
between it and her.
</p>

<p>
'The love of you came to me when first
you looked into my face,' he resumed, in
his melodramatic style; 'I remember it
was but a smile&mdash;a smile; yet a mist came
before my eyes&mdash;a something stirred my
heart.  Ah, Olive Raymond, it was your
beautiful eyes that suddenly kindled new
life within me&mdash;that will only end with
the old.'
</p>

<p>
Olive was more irritated than alarmed
now.
</p>

<p>
'How dare you come here?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'I can't help it&mdash;needs must when old
Boots drives,' said he; 'I came to show
you a work of art.  Look here.'
</p>

<p>
From his pocket-book he drew out and
held before her at arm's length the cabinet
photo of herself in a ball-dress; the photo,
or one like it, that she had the folly to
give him at Dundargue; but to her horror
and dismay she saw that it had been
reproduced, reversed, and manipulated in
some way by some low photographer, and
combined with one of Holcroft himself,
posed as if in the act of embracing her,
forming a strange group of two, whose
likenesses there would be no mistaking,
more especially that of her, as it was a
miraculous work of art in its truth and
individuality.
</p>

<p>
It was Olive to the life, with her
brightest and sweetest expression now
bent on his face!
</p>

<p>
'I am glad you recognise us,' said he,
mockingly, as he replaced the photo in its
receptacle, and the latter in his breast
pocket; 'and now to business.  What
would your drawing-room hero think of
this, if he saw it?  Ha, ha!  He did not
approve of Byron at Dundargue, I
remember&mdash;would rather we stuck to Dr. Watts'
hymns, I suppose&mdash;'How doth the little
busy bee," and so forth; well, like that
industrious insect, I mean to improve "the
shining hour."  How would he&mdash;how will
you and your family, with all their cursed
Scotch pride&mdash;like to see this photo in
every shop window exposed for sale to the
British public, among ballet-girls in
snowstorms, countesses swinging in hammocks,
bishops, and generals&mdash;murderers, too,
perhaps&mdash;eh?  In a week or two I may
have a million copies of this precious
photo for sale in London and elsewhere.
Do you realise the meaning of this, my
scornful beauty? and the result it must
have on you, your name, your character,
your family, and your future&mdash;Miss Olive
Raymond posed in the arms of Hawke
Holcroft?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, heavens!' said Olive, in a low voice
like a whisper; 'are you a man or a
devil?'
</p>

<p>
'A little of both, perhaps&mdash;I am what
circumstances have made me.'
</p>

<p>
'Daring wretch&mdash;oh, what wrong have I
ever done you that you should cross my
path and agonise me thus?'
</p>

<p>
Holcroft laughed; he knew that she had
a more than handsome allowance at her
guardian's behest and her own bank
account.  He was without remorse or
pity, for cowardice and selfishness were
alike the ruling features of his character,
and he thought to control the tongue and
action of Olive through her own pride and
her love of Allan with an eye to future
monetary extortions.
</p>

<p>
Pressing her left hand upon her heart,
as if she felt&mdash;as no doubt she did&mdash;a
spasm of pain there, and, with her eyes
almost closed, she said,
</p>

<p>
'In the name of mercy, give me back
that photo!'
</p>

<p>
'After I have had it so carefully
improved as a work of art?  No; no, Miss
Raymond,' said he, in his detestable sneering
tone; 'but I shall be content to forego
my interest in the copyright for a certain
reasonable consideration.'
</p>

<p>
'A consideration.  I do not understand
you, sir,' said Olive, faintly, and clutching
a table for support.
</p>

<p>
'Plainly, then, I mean a cheque for three
hundred&mdash;no, let me say four hundred&mdash;pounds,
and you had better be quick
about it, as I have no time to spare, and,
truth to tell, have no desire to renew my
acquaintance with any of the Aberfeldie
folks again.'
</p>

<p>
'Four hundred pounds?'
</p>

<p>
'That is the sum, Miss Raymond.'
</p>

<p>
Like a blind person, she feebly and irresolutely
seemed to grope with her key about
the lock of her davenport, and Holcroft said,
</p>

<p>
'Permit me to assist you.'
</p>

<p>
He unlocked it, and threw open the lid.
Mechanically she seated herself, and began
to write, while conscious that this bantering
villain was still addressing her.
</p>

<p>
'And so old Puddicombe has come to the
front again,' said he.  'An odd marriage
it will be&mdash;his with Miss Graham&mdash;Brummagem
allying itself with the Middle Ages&mdash;the
counting-house getting a line in
Burke's Peerage.'
</p>

<p>
'There,' said she, handing him the cheque,
which he received with a low mocking bow,
'now give me the photo.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, with pleasure.  Perhaps you
may wish to frame it.  Now, listen to me,'
he said, through his set teeth, 'if you divulge
a word of this interview, or make known
the power I have over you by means of this
photograph, "then and in that case," as I
believe your father's will is phrased, I shall
at once introduce it to the British public.
I give you this copy for your four hundred
pounds, but retain the negative!'
</p>

<p>
Then it was that, as he withdrew, a cry
escaped from her overcharged breast&mdash;the
cry overheard by Allan, and she had
only power left her to conceal the odious
photo in the breast of her dress, when she
fell fainting on the floor, where she was
found.
</p>

<p>
To destroy it was one of her first acts,
when consciousness returned, and she
was alone; but what availed the destruction
of this one, when her tormentor possessed
the power of producing others without
limit?
</p>

<p>
A great horror possessed her now&mdash;a
dread and gloom came over her, with a
painful nervous terror&mdash;a kind of hunted
emotion&mdash;a fear of what might next ensue!
</p>

<p>
Yet she took no one into her confidence,
not even Allan&mdash;on her part a fatal
error.
</p>

<p>
After all her past sweet intercourse with
him, their delayed marriage&mdash;delayed by
the illness incident to Holcroft's outrage&mdash;and
his too probable speedy departure on
foreign service, was she now to harrow
him up by a reference to her folly, her
petulance, and her silly degrading flirtation
with this man, who now proved such a
pitiful, such an unfathomable villain!
</p>

<p>
What if Allan should see suddenly that
fatal photo in a shop window?  This
possibility plainly stared her in the face;
yet she was silent, and believed that ere
this issue came to pass, she was doomed to
be tortured and victimised by Holcroft
again; and the thought, the fear of this,
gave her a kind of fever of the spirit, which
made her quite ill, and bewildered her
friends.
</p>

<p>
Money had evidently been given by her
to Holcroft&mdash;no small sum too; and for
what purpose?  Remembering his threat
if she exposed his rascality, her tongue
was now tied by a most unwise terror.
Ill and harrassed, she remained much in
her room and avoided society.
</p>

<p>
Allan, as he said resentfully, failed 'to
see the situation,' and in a gust of pique
and anger, feeling himself somewhat
degraded by Olive's bearing, resigned his
extended leave and joined his regiment, as
Olive said, resolved to 'sulk in Edinburgh
Castle, rather than have an explanation,'
rather unreasonably forgetting that she
had steadily refused to give one.
</p>

<p>
She felt painfully that the mystery of
the money given to Holcroft was calculated
to compromise her with her kindred; but
what was that when compared with the
awful thundercloud which hung over her,
if he made the public use he threatened of
the photo!
</p>

<p>
Her soul died within her.  Meanwhile
Allan struggled hard to make himself
believe that he might yet be happy with
Olive; that he had perhaps no solid reason
for being otherwise; but it would not do.
</p>

<p>
'Hang it, what does all this new
mystery mean?' he would say to himself.
'We seem fated to misunderstand each
other somehow.  After all, she seems to
love her pride more than me, still!'
</p>

<p>
And Olive knew that it was mingled
pride and fear that had opened a kind of
chasm between her and Allan again; yet a
little sense, a little courage and candour,
might have closed it speedily enough, and
smoothed away the anger the complication
raised at times within her; while to Allan
the situation was certainly an intolerable
one, and Olive's silence or reticence made
it all the more so.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
WEDDED.
</h3>

<p>
While baffled in her attempts to bring
about an explanation between Allan and
Olive, and to smooth matters over with
that wilful young lady (as she deemed her)
and her naturally irritated <i>fianc√©</i>, Lady
Aberfeldie pushed on vigorously all the
arrangements for the marriage of Sir Paget
and the ill-starred Eveline&mdash;a marriage
for which there seemed then no other
reason than an avaricious desire of grand
settlements and so forth.
</p>

<p>
All Olive's old pride and petulance (with
much of irritation that was new) seemed to
have come back to her, and, until the
matter was cleared up regarding that
mysterious visit of Holcroft to Maviswood, Allan
had ceased to speak of marriage, and thus
her spirit took fire at being doubted and
humbled.
</p>

<p>
She shrank, unwisely, from a simple
confession that might have obviated all
this, and from revealing the shame and
affront to which this man possessed the
power of exposing her.
</p>

<p>
'I detest riddles, and care not to read
them; but the mask she is wearing&mdash;if a
mask it be&mdash;may prove a costly one for
herself and us all,' thought Lord Aberfeldie
and his son too.
</p>

<p>
'Be content, Allan, to know that I gave
that money&mdash;a trifle to me&mdash;to Mr. Holcroft
in the hope to save us all&mdash;especially
myself&mdash;from a probable public affront
which might destroy me,' said Olive on one
occasion, her eyes flashing through her
tears.
</p>

<p>
'What mystery is this?&mdash;what can you
have done? how be in his power?  The
assertion is absurd!'
</p>

<p>
'Allan, cannot you trust me?' she asked,
fondly and sadly, yet proudly.
</p>

<p>
'I know not what to think, but the whole
affair looks&mdash;looks to me&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'How.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, devilish queer,' said he, as he cut
the matter short, and rode away, on which
Olive dried her tears, crested up her head,
and looked defiant.
</p>

<p>
'If this tiresome couple, Olive and Allan,
continue to pout and sulk at each other,'
said Lady Aberfeldie; 'and he should
decline to marry her, her money may be lost
to us by her twenty-fifth birthday.'
</p>

<p>
'Unless&mdash;&mdash;' the lord twisted his
moustache and paused.
</p>

<p>
'Unless what?'
</p>

<p>
'Allan gets himself killed in Egypt,'
replied Lord Aberfeldie, grimly.
</p>

<p>
'Good heavens, do not say such a thing,
even in jest!'
</p>

<p>
And now, perforce of their present
situation, a change had come over the two
cousins, Olive and Eveline&mdash;they never
read, studied, sung, rode, or walked
together, as they had been wont to do; a
blight had come over both their lives
apparently.
</p>

<p>
Eveline only felt a little at ease when
Sir Paget was absent from her, and even
then she was pestered by his love-letters,
which, like those written usually by men
of advanced years, were of a grotesquely
impassioned nature.  'Attachments at that
age are deeper, and less anxiety not to
compromise oneself is shown and felt,' says
an essayist.  'After fifty, men are often
wise enough to vote the writing of
love-letters a bore, but some carry on the
practice to a very advanced age.  Their
protestations are then ingeniously flavoured
with touches of the paternal, which sometimes
entirely mislead the unsophisticated
recipients.'
</p>

<p>
But the mere sight of Sir Paget's
caligraphy, and of his heraldic note-paper,
having a shield with some mysterious
design thereon, and the motto <i>Puddicombe
petit alta!</i> (Puddicombe seeks lofty
objects), proved always enough for Eveline,
who tossed it into the waste-paper basket
unread, but torn into minute fragments,
while a sigh of weariness and repugnance
escaped her.
</p>

<p>
Evan Cameron loved Allan Graham
dearly as a friend, and had naturally a
desire to be on the best terms with him as
the brother of the girl to whom he had
given all his heart.  Thus, while meeting
him daily on parade and at mess, he was
sorely puzzled to account for the change
he felt in Allan's manner to himself, as he
knew not that the latter resented the
'Mrs. Cameron' episode as an insult to
Eveline, his sister.
</p>

<p>
'I presume you know that my sister is
on the point of marriage&mdash;indeed, that the
day is fixed?' said Allan, rather grimly, to
him one day as he recalled the
circumstance of how Evan greatly admired, to
say the least of it, Eveline, and how her
heart had responded thereto.
</p>

<p>
Cameron made no reply, but a sudden
pallor overspread his handsome, bronzed
face, and all his studied calmness forsook
him, while the memory of past hopes and
joys shook his heart as if with a tempest
of remembrance; but, stooping and half
turning away to conceal the expression of
his face, he attempted to light a cigar.
</p>

<p>
'What a sly fellow&mdash;a cunning dog&mdash;you
are!' said Allan, with irritation of
tone.
</p>

<p>
'In what way do you mean, Allan?'
asked Cameron.
</p>

<p>
'Mean!  How dare you ask, after your
open admiration of my sister, Miss
Graham, in a man in your position?'
</p>

<p>
Cameron mistook his meaning; but the
mistake failed to rouse any pride, as his
heart was too crushed and sore just then.
</p>

<p>
'Allan!' he exclaimed, as tears almost
welled up in his honest eyes, 'I loved her&mdash;I
love her still&mdash;God alone knows how
well, how desperately, and how hopelessly.'
</p>

<p>
'Hopelessly indeed,' responded Allan,
his cheek now aflame with anger; 'and
you dare to tell me this after all that we
know of yourself and Mrs. Cameron?'
</p>

<p>
It was now Cameron's turn to look
indignant and astonished; but in a few words
he explained all.
</p>

<p>
'Poor Evan!' said Allan, as he wrung
the hand of Cameron, whose head sank
forward, so much was he overcome by
emotion; 'I am glad of this explanation,
but it comes too late&mdash;if indeed it could
ever have served any purpose so far as
your hopes with Eveline are concerned.  In
three days she is to be married&mdash;and now,
let us talk of the subject no more.'
</p>

<p>
But for a time black fury gathered in
the heart of Cameron at Sir Paget
Puddicombe, whose deductions, however, from
all that he saw at the railway station, were
most natural.
</p>

<p>
'In three days,' he muttered again and
again, 'in three days, and she will be lost
to me for ever!'
</p>

<p>
Eveline as yet was ignorant of her
lover's purity and innocence, nor would
the knowledge of it have availed her
much.  There was a meek abandonment
of her own will&mdash;of her own judgment,
and Lady Aberfeldie caressed her more
than she had ever done before, glad to find
that she had become&mdash;my lady cared not
why or how&mdash;compliant at last.
</p>

<p>
She seemed quite passive and supine&mdash;resigned,
Olive phrased it&mdash;and ready to
do her mother's bidding, for Evan Cameron
seemed to have quite passed out of her
life, though the name 'Alice' he had
uttered seemed to be ever in her ears.
</p>

<p>
She heard her mother speaking, and
felt her caresses, but her eyes were
suffused by a kind of mist.  Yet more than
once she had started amid her apathy, and
thought, 'Why am I still here&mdash;why don't
I run away to where they will never find
me?'
</p>

<p>
But she had no determining motive to
decide her choice of place or scheme of
life, though she felt that ere long, when
these last three days were past, she would
have to reconstruct her entire future, and
from that future her heart recoiled and
shrank.  Her temples throbbed as she
thought of this; her heart seemed alternately
to thunder in her breast, and then
to become unnaturally still.
</p>

<p>
Again and again her mother told her
that she would be surrounded by such
wealth as falls to the lot of few; but she
cared not for wealth, nor would it ever
remove her gloomy and bitter reflections,
and at the very name of her intended
husband, though she evinced no emotion, a
secret and involuntary shudder came over
her.
</p>

<p>
Society was intolerable just then, and
she had much of it at Maviswood.  How
intolerable seemed lawn-tennis amid the
bright sunshine, the soft thud of the balls
upon the racquets, as they were shot over
the nettings from court to court, the
laughter of young and sweet voices, and the
cries ever and anon of 'fifteen,' 'thirty,'
'fault,' and so on, as the jovial game
progressed; and with evening came the
inevitable dinner-party, and at night the
dance.
</p>

<p>
Allan, fearing to lacerate his sister's
heart, knew not how to undeceive her in
the matter of Cameron's supposed
duplicity, though the truth or falsehood
thereof could not affect her fate or her
relations with Sir Paget now; but the
true story escaped Carslogie quite
casually when in conversation with Olive, who
in due time related it to Eveline, in whose
breast it created some very mingled
emotions.
</p>

<p>
So Evan was innocent, while she had
been feeling in her heart all the passion
and pain&mdash;yea, a sentiment of vengeance&mdash;which
women will feel, when they believe
they have been loving unworthily.
</p>

<p>
Early on her marriage morning she left
her bed to think over all this.  Wrapped
in a snow-white <i>peignoir</i> (or dressing-robe),
with all her undressed hair floating about
her shoulders and blown back by the warm
summer breeze, she sat at the open
window of her room, and looked dreamily out
with sad, sad eyes on the sunny landscape
and the lovely hills all steeped in golden
haze.
</p>

<p>
How changed seemed its beauty now,
and how she longed to be away from it&mdash;to
be dead, in fact!  Yet she was at an
age when even to live, ought to be in itself
a joy.
</p>

<p>
The fragrance of the dewy summer
morning seemed to fill the outer world,
and amid the intense stillness she heard
only the voices of a lark high in the air
and of a cushat dove in the coppice.
</p>

<p>
Her marriage morning&mdash;what a morning
of woe to her!  Her cheeks were pale&mdash;very,
very pale; but with her parted scarlet
lips, and her tangled waves of rich
brown hair, she was beautiful as ever.
</p>

<p>
The knowledge that her lover had not
deceived her, but was true, roused her for
a time, and filled her soul with a tempest
of unexpected sorrow, compunction, and
joy&mdash;sorrow that she had wronged him,
compunction for the cruel mode in which
she had treated him, and joy that his
honour was unstained, and that he still was
true; but oh! what must he think of her?
</p>

<p>
Burying her face in her tremulous white
hands, she wept like a child&mdash;-wept as we
are told 'only women weep when their
hearts break over the grave of a dead
love,' and threw herself across her bed.
</p>

<p>
'God forgive me&mdash;God forgive me, and
bless and comfort you, my love,' she
murmured.  'Oh, Evan, I have wronged
you&mdash;wronged you; but what does it avail us
after all&mdash;after all?'
</p>

<p>
And she lay there crouched and gathered
in a heap, as it were, till Olive and others
who were to be her bridesmaids roused
her and lifted her up and summoned
Clairette.
</p>

<p>
So her marriage-day had come, and,
unless she fell ill or died, the ceremony
was to go inexorably on.
</p>

<p>
Olive was far from well; every day she
expected to hear of Holcroft's photo being
seen; her sole protection against that
catastrophe as yet, was the fear that ere it
came to pass, he would seek her presence
at least once again, on an errand of
extortion.  But ill or well, she had to bear her
part in the ceremony as a bridesmaid, and
a charming one she looked.
</p>

<p>
Allan, of course, was there too, but not
as groomsman&mdash;a 'fogie' friend of Sir
Paget officiated in that capacity, and more
than once did the head of the latter jerk
about in a way that was quite alarming as
he entered the church, which was <i>en f√™te</i>
for the occasion.
</p>

<p>
To the tortured mind of his bride, she
thought it would be a relief when the
ceremony was over, and the phantasmagoria
that seemed to surround her had all
passed away.  'Is not certainty better than
suspense?' asks Rhoda Broughton; 'night
better than twilight? despair than the
sickly flicker of an extinguishing hope?'
</p>

<p>
'In marrying in this compulsory fashion,
I do this poor man a great wrong,' thought
Eveline, 'and condemn myself to a
life-long sorrow.'
</p>

<p>
And amid the sacrifice Lady Aberfeldie,
calm and aristocratic, stood with a great
air of dignity and grace peculiarly her
own.
</p>

<p>
'She will love Sir Paget in time, if love
is necessary,' she was thinking; 'he is so
good, so generous, and <i>so</i> rich.'
</p>

<p>
So rich&mdash;yes, with her&mdash;there lay the
magnet and the secret of it all!
</p>

<p>
The bridesmaids, all handsome girls,
were uniformly costumed; among them
amber-haired Ruby Logan, quite jubilant
with reviving hopes of Allan.
</p>

<p>
Eveline's cold and now white lips murmured
almost inaudibly the words she was
bidden to say&mdash;the few but terrible words
that made her a wedded wife&mdash;while her
pallid face was but half seen amid the
bridal veil, that seemed to float like filmy
mist around her.  Allan alone, who knew
the real secret of her heart, looked pityingly,
darkly, and gravely on, for it was a
union of which&mdash;however his father and
mother desired it&mdash;he did not approve.
</p>

<p>
For a time Eveline had actually schooled
herself to think that marriage would give
her a species of vengeance on the man
who, she thought, had wronged and
oppressed her.  But now, oh, heaven! she
loved the lost one more than ever, while
death alone could unforge the fetters her
lips were riveting.
</p>

<p>
Was it ominous of evil that the ring
dropped from her wedding finger as Sir
Paget placed it there?
</p>

<p>
At last all was over.  The great organ
pealed forth the wedding-march.  The
bells rang joyously in the great spire
overhead, and she was led forth by Sir
Paget, leaning on his arm, a wedded
wife.
</p>

<p>
So time would pass on&mdash;days dawn and
nights close; the moon would shine amid
the fleecy clouds on the quiet pastoral
hills, on the great castellated mass of
Dundargue, the woods and waters of her old
home; but never would she be as she had
been&mdash;as a happy, thoughtless girl&mdash;the
Eveline Graham of the past years; never
more could joy be hers, or would she
know again the love she had lost, the
tenderness she had tasted; and times
there were when, amid her general passive
appearance of numbness and indifference,
hot, scorching tears of utter despair
escaped her, and a passionate longing
seized her to take to flight, whither she
knew not, and to rend asunder the meshes
of the marriage net that bound her now;
and in this frame of mind she departed
on her honeymoon!
</p>

<p>
On that morning, there lingered long
on one of the western batteries of the old
castle an officer who&mdash;if he was noticed
at all&mdash;seemed to be solely intent on
enjoying a cigar, and who seemed to
avoid the society of all.
</p>

<p>
This was poor Evan Cameron, listening
to the wedding bells in the distant spire,
and well he knew for what a tragedy they
were ringing; and, each time their
clangour came upon the wind, they seemed to
find an echo in his heart.
</p>

<p>
So she was married at last, and more
than ever lost to him!
</p>

<p>
Cards came to him in due course, and
he tore them into minute fragments.
</p>

<p>
Evan did all his regimental duties and
daily work like a man&mdash;but as one in a
dream&mdash;all that was required of him, with
more than ever, if possible, strict punctilio;
yet he felt himself a mere machine,
without heart or soul; and had only one
longing, for the time when he might turn
his back upon his native country, and find
himself face to face with the enemy, no
matter who, or where, that enemy might be.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
MISTRUST.
</h3>

<p>
'Now that dear Eveline is off our hands,'
said Lady Aberfeldie, 'I cannot help
thinking seriously of Allan's affairs and
those of Olive, and really some serious
advice should be given to the foolish
couple.  Could not you&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'No,' interrupted her husband; 'I wash
my hands of lovers and their piques and
plans.  You have managed the matter of
Eveline and Sir Paget&mdash;try your skill once
more.'
</p>

<p>
'Neither Allan nor Olive is so compliant
as poor Eveline.'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;poor Eveline indeed!'
</p>

<p>
'You think of her marriage thus, now?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, there is no denying it is rather
a January-and-May style of thing; but let
us not speak of it.'
</p>

<p>
Considering that her husband had from
the first given his full assent to the whole
transaction, Lady Aberfeldie could not
help glancing at him rather reproachfully,
but she only said,
</p>

<p>
'Olive has, of course, many admirers;
but the rumour of her engagement to
Allan keeps them all at a distance.'
</p>

<p>
'Poor Olive!  Her fortune is almost a
misfortune to her.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'She imagines it to be the attraction of
everyone, rather than her own beauty.'
</p>

<p>
'And once she conceived it to be the
attraction of Allan; but she knows better
now&mdash;that he loves, or loved, her for
herself alone.'
</p>

<p>
'She has already had two peers and a
baronet in her train, all drawn thither, I
fear, by her money-bags alone, and young
Carslogie of Ours seemed desperately
smitten, too.'
</p>

<p>
'Ours?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, I always think of the Black
Watch as 'Ours'&mdash;it is force of habit&mdash;a
good-looking fellow, well-born, well-bred,
with plenty of money.'
</p>

<p>
'Allan is his equal in all these and more;
but what he and she mean by dallying and
delaying as they do, I cannot conceive.'
</p>

<p>
Allan had looked upon Olive at the
recent marriage in her striking costume as
a bridesmaid, and thought she had never
appeared to greater advantage.
</p>

<p>
Why should she not have figured there
as a bride too?  What was the secret
spring of this doubt and mistrust that had
come between them again, and which she
shrank from attempting to explain?
</p>

<p>
To do her justice, she was often on the
point of doing so; but a sentiment of
miserable fear of what Allan might do,
think, or say, if made aware of the deep
affront Holcroft was capable of inflicting
upon his future wife, tied her tongue.
</p>

<p>
Better would it have been a thousand
times had she trusted to Allan fully and
implicitly, and to the means he might put
in force to procure or purchase the silence
for ever of such a reptile as her tormentor.
</p>

<p>
The knowledge in the minds of both,
that a time for separation must inevitably
come soon now, if all the rumours of war
proved true, softened their emotions, and
drew the cousins towards each other again.
</p>

<p>
The intercourse between them had, as
of old, its usual charm, but was strange
and constrained, for as Allan did not
attempt again the <i>r√¥le</i> of lover, but seemed
to 'bide his time,' Olive felt her pride
alarmed, and would often reply to him
coldly, with a straightening of her slim
form, and a cresting up of her graceful
neck and handsome head.
</p>

<p>
Time passed on; she heard nothing of
Hawke Holcroft or his threats, and the
courage of Olive rose; but it was awful to
think of her name being at the mercy of
such a creature, even if she were married!
</p>

<p>
Once the love that was really smouldering
in the hearts of both nearly burst into
a flame again.
</p>

<p>
Olive was seated in the garden at Maviswood
so deeply lost in thought that she
was unaware of Allan's approach until he
overhung the rustic sofa she occupied.
</p>

<p>
'A penny for your thoughts, Olive,' said
he.
</p>

<p>
'The sum usually offered for what might
prove a perilous secret to know.'
</p>

<p>
'Well?'
</p>

<p>
'My thoughts were of many things till
your voice scattered them,' said she,
twirling her sunshade on her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
'I was in hope they were of&mdash;me.'
</p>

<p>
Olive only smiled, and remained silent,
while he looked into her eyes with a
curiously mingled expression, which seemed
to be both imploring and commanding, but
she only said,
</p>

<p>
'They were not of you&mdash;why should they be?'
</p>

<p>
Allan drew back a pace, with a cloudy
brow.
</p>

<p>
'Forgive my being playful for a moment,
Olive&mdash;I shall never in this way offend you
again.'
</p>

<p>
She gave him a sweet and deprecating,
almost an entreating, glance; but Allan
did not perceive it; his face was turned
angrily and sadly from her, so her
pique&mdash;ever so ready&mdash;became roused.
</p>

<p>
'Olive,' said Allan, after a pause, 'love
should always be stronger than pride.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course&mdash;when love exists,' she
replied, turning a shoulder from him.
</p>

<p>
'And with you, Olive, do not let it stand
between us as before.  If your father's
will is again the cause, let me tell you
once more that I refuse to have any share
in that lunatic arrangement, and will not
marry you on any such conditions.'
</p>

<p>
'Who is thinking or talking of marriage?'
said she, sarcastically, yet making
an effort to restrain her tears; 'moreover,
I fear that as a husband you would be very
tyrannical and cruel.'
</p>

<p>
'My character in the present and the
past does not bear out this, I think.'
</p>

<p>
'Suspicious, then?'
</p>

<p>
'Not without extreme and just reason,'
replied Allan, as his mind flashed back to
the Holcroft episode.
</p>

<p>
She strove to glance at him defiantly,
but failing, smiled, though his handsome
face had in it an expression of sorrow and
anger.
</p>

<p>
'Ere a month be past, Olive, an
Egyptian bullet may make you every way a
free woman, so far as regards your father's
will.'
</p>

<p>
'I do not wish to be free from it,' she
was on the point of saying passionately,
but controlled her speech and
remained&mdash;unwisely&mdash;silent.
</p>

<p>
Allan regarded her wistfully.
</p>

<p>
'Are injudicious reticence and a little
aversion the best beginning of a true love?'
he asked.
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps&mdash;I am no casuist,' said she,
tapping the ground with a pretty little foot
impatiently.
</p>

<p>
Lovely, pouting, and wistful, her face
was now turned to his with a mixture
of petulance and shy reproach as she
thought,
</p>

<p>
'Oh, why does he not take me in his
arms, and kiss and make a fuss with me
as he used to do.'
</p>

<p>
But, repelled by her curious manner,
Allan had no intention of doing any such
thing, and thought her a curious enigma.
So thus the chance of a complete reunion
ended, and ere long the luckless Olive
was to have cause for repenting most
bitterly her lack of candour and perfect trust,
and the force of the overweening pride
which engendered mistrust in one who
loved her so well.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
THE BLACK WATCH.
</h3>

<p>
War with Egypt had been declared, and in
the Castle of Edinburgh, as in every other
fortress and barrack in the British Isles,
the notes of preparation were sounding,
and the Black Watch, ever so glorious in
the annals of our army, was among the
regiments bound for the land where, eighty
years before, it had gathered such a crop
of laurels under the gallant Abercrombie,
in conflict, not against a feeble horde of
Egyptians, but when encountering forty
thousand of the veteran infantry of
France.
</p>

<p>
From that day in the October of 1739
when the companies of <i>Freicudan Dhu</i>, or
Black Watch (so called from their
sombre green tartans), drawn from the
Munroes of Ross, the Grants of Strathspey,
and the Campbells of Lochnelland Carrick,
were first enrolled as a regiment on the
Birks of Aberfeldie, near the southern
bank of the Tay, by the gallant old Earl
of Crawford, the 42nd has been second to
none in peace and war, and its very name
and number are rendered dear to the
people of Scotland by innumerable ties of
friendship and clanship, by traditions and
glorious exploits in battle.
</p>

<p>
In almost everything that has added
strength or brilliance to the British
Empire the regiment has borne a leading part,
and to attempt to trace its annals would
be to write the history of our wars since
the days of the second George.
</p>

<p>
Suffice it that the second year after the
companies were constituted a regiment,
saw them fighting for the House of
Austria against France and Bavaria, and
covering the rear of that British army
which was hurled from the heights of
Fontenoy by the bayonets of the Irish
Brigades, and where, we are told,
'the gallantry of Sir Robert Munroe of
'the gallantry of Sir Robert Munroe of
Culcairn and his Highlanders was the
theme of admiration through all Britain.'
</p>

<p>
So it was with them in the old Flanders
war, till 1758 saw them attacking
Ticonderoga in America, where, rushing from
amid the Reserve, where they disdained to
linger, they hewed down the dense abatis
with their claymores, and, storming the
breastworks, 'climbing up one another's
shoulders, and placing their feet in the
holes made in the face of the works by
their swords and bayonets, no ladders
having been provided,' exposed the while
to a dreadful fire of cannon and musketry,
under which six hundred and forty-seven
of them fell; and hence a cry for vengeance
went through the country of the clans,
procuring so many recruits, and another
battalion was formed, and fresh glories
were won in the West India Isles, where,
at Martinique and by the walls of the
Moro, their pipes sent up the notes of
victory.
</p>

<p>
In the fatal strife of the American revolt
they were ever in the van, and the first
years of the present century saw their
tartans waving darkly amid the
battle-smoke of Aboukir, under the shadow of
Pompey's Pillar, and on the plains of
Alexandria, where they cut to pieces the
French Invincibles, slew six hundred and
fifty of them, captured their colours, which
were delivered to Major Stirling, together
with the cannon they had also seized;
and ere long the mosques and towers
of Grand Cairo echoed to their martial
music.
</p>

<p>
Who can record the brilliance of their
valour in the long and glorious war of the
Peninsula&mdash;that war of victories, which
began on the banks of the Douro and
continued to the hill of Toulouse?  And
anon, their never-to-be-forgotten prowess
on the plains of Waterloo, when, under
Macara, they formed the flower of Picton's
superb division, and where, with the Greys
and Gordon Highlanders, they sent up the
cry which still finds echo in every Scottish
heart, the <i>cri-de-guerre</i> of 'Scotland for
ever!' while plunging into those mighty
French columns, which rolled away before
their bayonets like smoke before the wind.
</p>

<p>
There their total casualties were two
hundred and ninety-seven of all ranks.
</p>

<p>
'They fought like heroes, and like heroes
fell&mdash;an honour to the country,' to quote
the War Office Record, page 145.  'On
many a Highland hill, and through many
a Lowland valley, long will the deeds of
these brave men be fondly remembered
and their fate deeply deplored.  Never did
a finer body of men take the field; never
did men march to battle that were destined
to perform such services to their country,
and to obtain such immortal renown.'
</p>

<p>
But equal renown did their services win
on the banks of the Alma, when old Colin
Campbell led them into action, exclaiming,
</p>

<p>
'Now, men, the whole army is watching
us; make me proud of my Highland
Brigade!'
</p>

<p>
And reason indeed had that grand old
soldier to be proud of his lads in the kilt,
as they swept up the green hillsides to
glory.  'The ground they had to ascend,'
says an eye-witness, the author of 'Eothen,'
'was a good deal more steep and broken
than the slope beneath the redoubt.  In
the land where those Scots were bred,
there are shadows of sailing clouds
shimmering up the mountain side, and their
paths are rugged and steep, yet their
course is smooth, easy, and swift.  Smoothly,
easily, and swiftly the Black Watch
seemed to glide up the hill.  A few
minutes before their tartans ranged dark in
the valley; now their plumes were on the
crest.'
</p>

<p>
Into the dense grey masses of the Kazan
column, over which towered the miraculous
figure of St. Sergius, their steady
volley swept like a sheet of lead; anon
their line of bayonets was flashing to the
charge like a hedge of steel, and a wail of
despair broke from the Muscovites, who,
crying that 'the Angel of Death had come,'
threw away all that might impede their
speed and fled.
</p>

<p>
'Then,' says the brilliant author we
have quoted, 'rose the cheers of the
Highland Brigade.  Along the Kourgan√©
slopes, and thence west almost home
to the causeway, the hillsides were
made to resound with that joyous
and assuring cry, which is the
natural utterance of a northern people so
long as it is warlike and free.'
</p>

<p>
Their furious onset struck terror to
many an Indian heart during the dark
years of the Sepoy revolt, and like sweetest
music their pipes were heard by that
desperate and despairing band who fought
for their wives and children in beleaguered
Lucknow; and as, of course, the old Black
Watch must be in everything, they bore
their share in the conquest of Coomassie,
and were the first men in the sable city,
as their pipes announced to the army of
Wolseley.
</p>

<p>
While on this subject, we cannot help
quoting a Frenchman's estimate of the
Scottish troops.  In the <i>Moniteur de Soir</i>
for 1868, a writer says,
</p>

<p>
'The Scottish soldiers form without
distinction the cream of the British army,
and the Highlander is the prototype of
the excellent soldier.  He has all the
requisite qualities without one defect.
Unluckily for Great Britain, the population of
Scotland is not numerous.  Saving, it is
true, to the point of putting by penny after
penny, the Scotsman, for all that, is
honest, steadfast, and amiable in his
intercourse with others, enthusiastic and proud,
most chivalrous when the question is
about shedding his blood.  The old
traditions of clanship subsist, each company
is grouped round an illustrious name, and
all and every man is sure to be the
captain's cousin.  The Highlanders have a
strange sort of bravery, which partakes of
French fire and English phlegm.  They rush
with impetuosity, they charge with vigour,
but are not hurried away by anger.  In the
very hottest of an attack, a simple order
suffices to stop them.  Formed in square,
you would take them for Englishmen, but
in the bayonet charge you would swear
they were French.  For the rest they are
of Celtic origin, and the blood of our
fathers flows in their veins.  In the eyes
of the Turk, the Scots have one enormous
fault&mdash;that of showing their bare legs.
In <i>our</i> eyes they have but one defect, but
still excessively annoying&mdash;their depraved
taste for the screaming of the bagpipes.
We know that the Highlanders would not
get under fire (with <i>√©lan</i>) without being
excited by their national airs being played
on this discordant instrument.  One of
their generals having put down this
piercing music, they attacked the enemy so
languidly that the bagpipes had to be
restored to them, and then they took the
position.  In a word, we repeat that the
Scots are magnificent soldiers.'
</p>

<p>
We may smile at the Frenchman's idea
of the pipes, for as the old piper said of
Count Flauhault when he expressed his
disgust thereat, 'Maybe she heard owre
muckle o' them at Waterloo.'
</p>

<p>
And now once again the Black Watch
were going to the land of the sun and the
desert, where Abercrombie received his
death-wound while calling to them in the
charge, 'My brave Highlanders, remember
your country&mdash;remember your forefathers!'  And
these glories, with all 'the
stirring memories of a thousand years,'
were not forgotten on that day in the
August of 1882 when, under the scion of
a gallant house, Cluny the younger, the
regiment received its orders of readiness
and began to prepare for its departure
from the Castle of Edinburgh, while a
mighty throb seemed to pervade the heart
of the city as its hour of departure
approached.
</p>

<p>
All in its ranks, of course, had friends
whom they sorrowed to leave&mdash;all save
poor Evan Cameron; and all were
impatient and full of ardour to join in the
coming strife; but none, perhaps, were
more impatient than he, for he had to seek
forgetfulness&mdash;oblivion from his own
thoughts&mdash;a refuge from his futile
regrets&mdash;among other scenes for the lost love of
one who could never be more to him than
a tender memory now.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
IN THE BELVIDERE.
</h3>

<p>
Shakespeare tells us that men have died
and worms have eaten them, but not for
love.  So Evan Cameron did not die, nor
had he any thoughts of dying; but it
seemed to his young and enthusiastic
heart just then that all which made life
worth living for, and all its fulness,
splendour, and joy, were over and done with
for him.
</p>

<p>
Of the movements of the Aberfeldie
family he knew nothing at that time.
</p>

<p>
Allan was again on leave, and was to
join the regiment on the day of its
embarkation in England.
</p>

<p>
Evan had a longing to see the place
where he had last seen Eveline, as her
lover, at Maviswood.  Memories of the
past days at Dundargue came vividly upon
him now&mdash;of the times when they had
wandered in the leafy woods near the old
castle, talking sweet nonsense, with happy
hearts and laughter that came so readily;
when eye spoke to eye and hand thrilled
when it touched hand with lingering pressure,
and glances were exchanged that, if
they meant anything, meant love.
</p>

<p>
Lord Aberfeldie had been ever kind to
him, and a friend of his father; he thought
he would like to press the good peer's
hand once more before he departed, for
the regiment was going far away, to a
land from whence he might never return;
so, as Evan was an impulsive young
fellow, he repaired at once to Maviswood.
</p>

<p>
He found Mr. Tappleton, the old family
butler, airing his figure at the front door
when he approached.
</p>

<p>
Lord Aberfeldie, he was informed, was
in London&mdash;his lordship was residing with
Miss Raymond at Southsea, and Sir Paget
was not at home.
</p>

<p>
'Sir Paget&mdash;is he living here?' asked
Cameron, with a start.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir, for a few days.'
</p>

<p>
'And Lady&mdash;Lady&mdash;&mdash;'  He paused,
unable to pronounce the name.
</p>

<p>
'Is also here,' replied Mr. Tappleton,
knowing instantly who he meant; 'but
she is out somewhere walking in the
grounds.'
</p>

<p>
Evan gave the butler a couple of cards
and turned away.  He felt quite startled
to find that Sir Paget and his bride were
resident at Maviswood, and thought that
he could not get away from the vicinity of
the house too soon.
</p>

<p>
Proceeding down the avenue, he passed
a narrow, diverging path between high
old holly-hedges, the vista of which was
closed by a belvidere, or species of pillared
alcove, built upon a grassy knoll, and
therein, as if in a shrine, stood Eveline.
</p>

<p>
To pass was impossible.  For a moment
he stood rooted to the spot, and then, as
one in a dream, approached her.  To meet
her face to face thus, was like something
of a dreadful shock to both now.
</p>

<p>
Eveline was deadly pale and trembling,
while her graceful figure looked very
slight and girlish in her fresh cambric
costume and gipsy hat.
</p>

<p>
At the very moment of their meeting
there, her mind had been full of him.
</p>

<p>
How had poor Evan borne the tidings
of her marriage, and with it the total
destruction of their mutual wishes?&mdash;mutual
hopes they had none.
</p>

<p>
She had often pondered on this, and
wondered how he had heard it, who had
told him of it, or if he had seen it in the
papers, and how he looked when the sad
tidings came.  Of the cruel mockery of
sending him wedding-cards she knew
nothing.  Was he striving to forget
er? perhaps learning to hate her&mdash;oh, not
that!&mdash;to despise her? nor that, if he
knew all.
</p>

<p>
But they were nothing to each other
now, and never could be anything more.
</p>

<p>
Anon would come other thoughts that
were perilous to a young and enthusiastic
girl.
</p>

<p>
Evan Cameron had given himself to
her with all his heart, and with all his
soul, and he loved her with all the strength
of both; and now&mdash;now, with another
man's wedding-ring upon her finger, she
felt unprepared to relinquish that love,
for she could not doubt that it must still
exist, though he had been cruelly and
selfishly treated.
</p>

<p>
And while all these thoughts had been
coursing through her brain he came
suddenly before her.
</p>

<p>
'I pray that he may soon forget
me&mdash;poor Evan!' had been her frequent
thought.  'Why should he think of me
more, when he knows of my marriage,
and must deem me a pitiful creature.'
</p>

<p>
Each caught their breath, each clasped
their hands as if in mute misery, and the
eyes of both were strained, as if the pain
of recognition was mingled with the peril
of the situation.
</p>

<p>
Evan thought how pale and transfigured
looked the soft face of his lost love!
</p>

<p>
'I knew not that you where here&mdash;I
came to visit your father&mdash;we march
tomorrow&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
Evan paused breathlessly, though his
voice seemed to thrill with passion, and
his lips, when they touched her
hands&mdash;even the hand with the obnoxious
wedding-hoop&mdash;trembled and quivered
like those of a girl.
</p>

<p>
'Evan,' she said, softly, 'Evan!'
</p>

<p>
'My darling&mdash;my lost darling!' broke
from his lips, as he clasped her in his
arms, and her slender fingers softly and
tremulously caressed his dark and
closely-curling hair with something that was
almost motherly, or sisterly, in the
intensity of its tenderness.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Evan,' she whispered, 'may God
watch over you, spare you, protect you,
and give you some other heart to make
you happy.'
</p>

<p>
It was some solace to Evan's wounded
spirit that she had been in a manner&mdash;apart
from her temporary doubt of
himself&mdash;forced into her marriage; that her
own free will, poor girl, had no hand in
the matter.
</p>

<p>
Clasped to his heart, hers was beating
for some moments 'with the wild music
of recovered joy, her great dread silenced
by her greater passion.'
</p>

<p>
But to what end was it all?
</p>

<p>
'This is madness!' exclaimed Evan, as
they stood for a minute, hand clasped
in hand, and gazing into each other's
eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Madness indeed!' moaned Eveline.
</p>

<p>
'I am going far away, my darling, and
shall never see you again.  That I may
find a grave in Egypt is the kindest wish
you can have for me; and that you will
never think but kindly of me in the time
to come, is my only and my dearest hope
now.'
</p>

<p>
She was in his arms again&mdash;the girl,
every tress of whose brown-golden hair
was dear to him&mdash;every expression of
whose eyes and lips, every tone of whose
voice, every charm and grace of whose
face and form were graven on his inner
heart; but what availed all that now?
</p>

<p>
'You know all now&mdash;my secret, and
that I was not false to you, Eveline?'
said he.
</p>

<p>
'All,' she replied, hollowly.
</p>

<p>
'Poor Alice could not come to my
quarters in the Castle, consequently I
had to meet her somewhere&mdash;where you
saw us.  Poor little soul, she had no
one to trust, to&mdash;to confide in, save me.'
</p>

<p>
'And now&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'She has gone back to her husband&mdash;back
to my brother in India.'
</p>

<p>
'Desperate with the idea that you,
Evan, had deceived me, I was
blind&mdash;careless&mdash;passive in their hands, and
heedless what became of me; and Sir
Paget bought me of them&mdash;bought me
of papa and mamma&mdash;as a slave who
loathes her buyers and her slavery!'
exclaimed Eveline, wildly.
</p>

<p>
'Such a fate, my darling!'
</p>

<p>
'Such a fate, indeed!' she whispered
through her set teeth.  'But we must
part now,' she added, but without
withdrawing her hands from his firm clasp.
</p>

<p>
'A parting bitter as death, Eveline.'
</p>

<p>
'And as hopeless,' she said, now sobbing
heavily.
</p>

<p>
'Yet, with all its bitterness, this has
been a great, an unexpected joy to see you
here, to embrace you once again.'
</p>

<p>
Of one grim fact they could not be
oblivious.  She was another man's wife, and
he had to tear himself away; to lose for
ever the sight of that sweet, afflicted face,
the tones of that beloved voice, to long
again for both, with eager eyes and ears,
in the time that was to come.
</p>

<p>
'Though parted thus, Eveline, you will
think of me sometimes&mdash;you will remember?'
</p>

<p>
'For ever and for ever, while my miserable
life lasts, Evan.'
</p>

<p>
'My poor darling!  To remember me,
to be constant to me in memory, while
another's wife.'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot realise that even now, still
less what my life will be in the future, with
you not in it.'
</p>

<p>
A long, clinging kiss and he was gone,
while Eveline sank down on the stone
seat within the belvidere in a state of
semi-consciousness, in which she was
discovered by Sir Paget.

CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
THE ROUTE.
</h3>

<p>
Few scenes are more stirring than the
departure of a regiment for the seat of war,
in Scotland, perhaps, more than anywhere
else, when it is the departure of a
national regiment endeared to the people
by historical and warlike associations,
combined with those of clanship and kindred.
</p>

<p>
The last toast at the mess, ere it was
broken up, was '<i>Tir nam Bean, nan Glean,
s nan Gaisgaich</i>;' and now, till more
peaceful times, its magnificent and trophied
mess-plate was stored away, among it that
gigantic silver tripod, with its fluted bowl,
weighing eighteen hundred ounces,
bearing, with other mottoes, these:&mdash;<i>Na Tir
chaisin Buardh son Eiphart</i> 21 <i>Mar,</i> 1801'
and&mdash;'<i>O'Chummin Gaidhculach d' on
Freicudan Dhu, na</i> 42 <i>Regiment</i>.'
</p>

<p>
About seven in the morning the pipers
of the Black Watch blew the gathering,
waking the echoes of that grand old
fortress, which is the focus of so much
Scottish history, and from the gates of which
by sword or spear the tide of war was so
often rolled back in the stormy days of
old; and now the sound of the pipes
found a deeper echo in the hearts of the
thousands who were mustering in the
streets below to bid the regiment farewell,
and wish it God-speed in the land it was
going to.
</p>

<p>
The August morning was a lovely one,
and the shadows formed by the golden
sunshine lay purple and deep in the glens
of the Pentlands, and in the valleys and
hollows spanned by the bridges of the city
and overlooked by the towering edifices
of its terraced streets, amid which rose
every spire and pinnacle tipped with ruddy
splendour.
</p>

<p>
The woods and gardens were still in all
their summer beauty and greenery, and
the corn-fields in the distance were ripe
with golden grain over all the sun-lighted
landscape.  Ere that corn was all gathered,
many of those who came gaily forth,
mustering to the sound of the pipes,
were to find their graves in the sand of
the Egyptian desert, where the Black
Watch had gathered so many laurels in
the wars of other years.
</p>

<p>
All the city was astir as it had never
been since the King's Own left the same
fortress for the shores of the Crimea,
and the hum of the gathering thousands
filled the clear air of the dewy morning.
</p>

<p>
Cluny trusted in his men, and thus, on
this conspicuous morning, no man failed
him, and no man was absent from his
place in the ranks.  The bustle of
departure was past; stores had been
issued; the grey tropical helmet, with a
little crimson hackle worn on the left
side, was for a time to supersede the
graceful bonnet with its black plumes;
valises and haversacks had been packed;
rifles and bayonets inspected; the baggage
selected and forwarded; and nothing
remained now but to march, after sixteen
months' residence in the city of the
Stuarts.
</p>

<p>
Cluny had kindly given ample opportunities
to his men to take leave of their
friends, and it was only for a short time
before their departure, that the great
palisaded barriers of the Castle were closed at
the <i>t√™te-du-pont</i> against all comers, and the
human surge that pressed against them.
</p>

<p>
At last the pipes were heard echoing
under that deep archway through which
millions of armed men have marched; the
brass drums rang under the grim ports of
the Half-Moon Battery; the barriers were
rolled back, and, with dragoons clearing
the way, the Black Watch, in their fighting
kits, with grey helmets, white jackets,
and dark-green tartans, their colours cased,
and all their bayonets glittering in the
sun like a rippling stream of steel, came
marching down the slope, while cheers
rent the air, cheers and shouts, though
doubtless many a heavy heart was there,
for wives and sweethearts, children and
parents, alike were being left behind by
those on whose faces they might never
look again.
</p>

<p>
Each man had on his back a valise, tin
canteen, and great-coat; his haversack and
water-bottle were slung, and attached to
a lanyard at his neck, each carried a large
knife&mdash;like the genuine jockteleg of the
days of old&mdash;and right service-like and
purpose-like they all looked.
</p>

<p>
The officers, who were in blue patrol
jackets, with kilt, claymore, and dirk,
carried knives of the same kind, together
with a haversack, field-glass, and water-bottle.
</p>

<p>
Dense were the crowds occupying every
street, every window and balcony, every
coign of vantage, and the whole area
through which the regiment marched to
the sound of its national and martial
music seemed instinct with life, ardour,
and enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
Many veterans were in the ranks of the
regiment&mdash;men who had served in
Ashanti, and not a few who, as Albany
Highlanders, had marched to Candahar and
fought in Afghanistan.  Their colonel&mdash;Cluny
the younger, son of that venerable
Cluny who is chief of the Macphersons or
Clanvurich (the second tribe of the great
Clan Chattan), and was once a Black
Watchman&mdash;rode at their head, and near
him marched his favourite sergeant-major,
MacNeil, a tall, stately, and tried soldier,
who, though he knew not the fate before
him, when the hour came, had no fear of
facing death, as became one of the
Freicudan Dhu.
</p>

<p>
Evan Cameron, as he marched on,
claymore in hand, had a shrewd idea that
among the many there whose tender hearts
were filled with pity and enthusiasm, would
be one who was secretly and inexpressibly
dear to himself; and yet, though a kind of
mortal pain was in his breast, his heart,
despite it all, beat responsive to the
cadence of the old familiar march&mdash;the
regimental quick-step&mdash;the same air to which
he had so often trod in past times and in
other lands; and now, as one in a dream,
he saw the seething crowds, the forest of
waving hats and handkerchiefs, and all the
glorious view on which he was probably
looking for the last time&mdash;the noble line
of Princes Street, steeped in the morning
sun, the Calton Hill with its line of towers
and battlements, its temples, great stone
obelisk, and reproduction of the classic
Parthenon of Minerva, Arthur's Seat, and
the Craigs, and the old city with its
ten-storey houses&mdash;each a stone record of the
historic past.
</p>

<p>
He was suddenly roused on seeing Carslogie
playfully kiss the basket hilt of his
claymore, and wave his hand to a young
lady who sat by the side of an elderly
gentleman in an open barouche.
</p>

<p>
She was closely veiled, but Evan's heart
leaped in his breast when he recognised
Eveline&mdash;Eveline by the side of Sir Paget,
who waved his hat occasionally, and
jerked his bald head about as usual.
</p>

<p>
'Why was such a girl as that, Allan
Graham's sister, sacrificed to that old
devil of a fogie?' asked one of the Black
Watch of Carslogie, a high-spirited young
fellow, who thought it very nice to be in
the 42nd, but very nasty to be also in debt,
and was now right glad to find himself <i>en
route</i> for Egypt.
</p>

<p>
'Why, indeed? you may well ask,' he
replied; 'simply because her father is one
of the upper ten, and, like all that lot,
selfish to the backbone.'
</p>

<p>
And Cameron's heart endorsed his
answer to the full.
</p>

<p>
Eveline saw him, and for a moment&mdash;but
a moment only&mdash;raised her, veil.
</p>

<p>
The tale of all she had endured was
written in the wistful and mournful
expression of her soft hazel eyes, and all
who knew her now remarked that, though
she sometimes smiled, she never
laughed.
</p>

<p>
She felt her lips quiver and the lines of
them tighten, for we may control deep
emotion in the eyes, but on the mouth,
never.
</p>

<p>
Her whole heart and soul were concentrated
in the effort to appear calm and
look on, though her eyes were dim with
the tears in which she feared just then to
indulge.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, my darling!' she whispered to herself,
again and again, but voicelessly, in
her heart.  'My dear love&mdash;my brave
Evan&mdash;I shall never see you again!'
</p>

<p>
Surreptitiously she concealed her
tear-soaked handkerchief in her pocket, and
drew forth another&mdash;a fresh one redolent
of eau-de-Cologne.  Quickly though she
did it, Sir Paget saw the act, drew his own
conclusions therefrom, and thought
himself an ass for having accorded her
permission to see the Black Watch
depart.
</p>

<p>
Their recent brief meeting&mdash;the memory
of the passionate kisses that should
never have been given or taken&mdash;added
now to the supremeness of the present
moment.
</p>

<p>
He only appeared to bow to her; but as
he gazed with eyes of passionate yearning
on her flower-like face, the lips he had
kissed so often, the eyes that had so often
looked with love into his, and did so now,
his heart filled with a wild and desperate
longing to take her to his breast and cover
her face with kisses again.
</p>

<p>
But the drums beat, the pipes played
loud and high, the crowds cheered, and
the forward march went ruthlessly on.
</p>

<p>
All this fuss of Eveline's, thought Sir
Paget, could not be merely for the
departure of her brother's regiment!
</p>

<p>
At last to Eveline's ears the sound of
pipe and drum died away in the distance
as the barouche was driven homeward to
Maviswood; but now the despair in her
face and attitude was too palpable not to
attract the attention of Sir Paget, who
jerked his face forward quite close to
hers and regarded her gloomily and in
silence.
</p>

<p>
In all that followed now, Evan Cameron
seemed to act mechanically, and to do that
which was his duty by mere force of
habit, as the regiment marched into the
resounding railway station, where he saw
the men of his company told-off to
compartments; saw the sergeants marking on
the footboard of the carriages with chalk
the letter of the company; saw the men
take off their valises; and ere long the
swift special train was sweeping through
the dark tunnel that pierces the rocky
bowels of Calton Hill, and the Black
Watch were fairly off for Egypt again.
</p>

<p>
How to bear his loss in the long years
that were to come, if the fortune of war
spared him, was the thought that tortured
most the mind of Cameron then, and gave
him an emotion of despair.
</p>

<p>
He remembered the fixed and agonised
gaze of Eveline; he remembered, too, the
manner in which her spouse had looked
grimly on, with an angry, yet not unsatisfied,
jerk of the head, as he, no doubt, was
thinking they 'had seen the last of Evan
Cameron.'
</p>

<p>
The future!  All that was vague to the
latter indeed.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
'IDIOTS ONLY WILL BE COZENED TWICE.'
</h3>

<p>
It was on an August evening&mdash;the sun
had not set, but the sky was cloudy and
gloomy; the wind was high, and a heavy
sea was on at Spithead, and the conservatory
in which Olive was lingering and
selecting a button-hole of violets and
maiden-hair fern for Allan was so dark
already that the lamps were lighted in it.
She was dressed for a dinner-party, and
was looking charming&mdash;her best and
brightest&mdash;as she sang softly to herself
and wandered from one shelf of potted
flowers to another, when Allan suddenly
joined her, with an expression in his face
that was full of mingled sadness and
excitement, and with a telegram in his hand.
</p>

<p>
'Allan, what has happened?' she asked,
changing colour, and with dire forebodings
in her heart.
</p>

<p>
He caught her hands in his and tried to
smile.
</p>

<p>
'Tell me, why are you so sad?' she
asked again.
</p>

<p>
'Darling,' said he, as he drew her to his
breast, 'compose yourself; I have just had
great news&mdash;bad news you will deem them&mdash;to
tell you.'
</p>

<p>
From these few speeches it may be
gathered that the cloud that hovered
between this pair of lovers had passed away,
and that sunshine had come again.
</p>

<p>
They were at Puddicombe House, a villa
of Sir Paget's, which he had lent to Lord
Aberfeldie, and from the windows of which,
as it overlooked Stokes Bay and Spithead
from the Clarence Parade at Southsea,
they could daily see the departure of great
white 'troopers,' crowded with soldiers&mdash;Highlanders,
Rifles, and Marines&mdash;steaming
past the long line of the sea-wall (with
all its naval trophies and monuments) <i>en
route</i> for the shores of Egypt.
</p>

<p>
There, too, were in view the three forts
in the Channel, with Puckpool Battery at
Spring Yale, which, with the other in a
line on the mainland, would effectually bar
an enemy's ship from reaching Portsmouth
Harbour.  Ponderous indeed are these
forts&mdash;one in particular, a mass of circular
masonry, girt by a black belt of iron
armour, pierced with port-holes, through
which the great guns of 'the period' may
spit out shot and shell; and beyond lies
the peaceful Isle of Wight&mdash;a charming
stretch of sloping land, wooded to the
water's edge, and studded with beautiful
mansions.
</p>

<p>
'You have bad news to tell me?' said
Olive, as the haunting terror that was ever
before her struck a pang to her heart.
</p>

<p>
'I must rejoin my regiment at once; it
leaves the Castle of Edinburgh to-morrow
for Egypt, and I am to meet it at Woolwich,
where the transport awaits it.  Oh,
how hard it is to part with you&mdash;even for
a time,' he added, caressing her, as her
head dropped upon his breast; 'to part
thus, and unmarried yet, Olive&mdash;after all
our past folly, jealousies, and waste of
time.  Speak to me, darling!'
</p>

<p>
'What can I say, Allan?' replied Olive,
piteously, as her tears fell fast.
</p>

<p>
'We shall not go to this dinner-party
at the Port Admiral's, of course.  Our
last evening must be spent together.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Allan, Allan!'
</p>

<p>
'Take off those evil diamonds,
darling&mdash;those stones of ill omen.  Why did
the mater let you wear them?  They
are never produced without something
happening.'
</p>

<p>
'And the transport sails&mdash;when?'
</p>

<p>
'On Tuesday evening.'
</p>

<p>
'So soon&mdash;so very soon!'
</p>

<p>
'My darling&mdash;my own&mdash;don't weep so,'
said he, pressing her closer to his breast,
and nestling her face in his neck, while
he caressed and tried to soothe her; but
the impulsive Olive would neither be
soothed nor comforted for a time.
</p>

<p>
When, however, she became calmer, he
said,
</p>

<p>
'I must leave you for a few minutes.
I must telegraph to the adjutant, see the
mater, poor soul, and send apologies, as
we shall not go to the admiral's to-night.'
</p>

<p>
He left her; and, sinking into a sofa,
she abandoned herself to a stormy fit of
weeping and to sad and bitter reflections,
and to many unavailing regrets&mdash;unavailing
now, as they were to be parted
so soon; and one grim and harrowing
fact stood darkly out amid them all&mdash;her
affianced lover was going to the seat of
war and disease, to face unnumbered perils
in that fatal land of Egypt!
</p>

<p>
A slight sound roused her, and drew
her attention to a glass-door of the
conservatory that opened to the garden.
</p>

<p>
A man's face seemed glued against it&mdash;a
face white and ghastly, apparently
regarding her fixedly&mdash;the face of Hawke
Holcroft, emaciated by dissipation, want, or
disease&mdash;probably by all three&mdash;his shifty
eyes bloodshot and wild in expression.
</p>

<p>
In another moment she would have
screamed with terror; but he opened the
door, entered, and stood before her.
</p>

<p>
'I never thought&mdash;at least, I was in
hope never to see you again,' said Olive,
starting up, and recoiling from him.
</p>

<p>
'Ha&mdash;indeed.  But in this world are
not those always meeting who are better
far apart?' was his mocking response.
</p>

<p>
'What brings you here&mdash;what do you
want?' asked Olive, gathering courage
from desperation, and trembling in her
soul lest Allan should return and find
this villainous intruder there.
</p>

<p>
'What do I want!  Money.  I am, and
have been for days, starving.'
</p>

<p>
'Money I shall not be weak enough to
give you again, under any threat or any
pressure.  The last I gave you cost me
dearly,' said Olive, firmly, though terrified
to find herself face to face with this
would-be assassin again.
</p>

<p>
'You will not?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'Then give me these jewels&mdash;these
diamonds,' he said, hoarsely; and, ere she
could move or speak, he snatched up the
necklace and pendants from a pedestal
on which she had placed them, and thrust
them into his breast-pocket.  'For a time,
now, the work of art I possess shall be
withheld from the British public&mdash;but for
a time only&mdash;and in the memory of the
time when you loved me, or led me to
believe that you did.'
</p>

<p>
'Insolent&mdash;how dare you say so?' she
exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'You tried to win my heart, and won
it, too&mdash;you played with me fast and
loose, as you did with your cousin, for
whom you did not care one doit, then at
least, and for whom I believe you care
nothing now.'
</p>

<p>
Olive glanced round her in dismay, for
should such words as these, and others
that followed them, reach listening ears,
she might be lost, and she was powerless
to stay the impetuous current of his
studiously mischievous speech.  Moreover,
she did not see what Hawke Holcroft
saw behind some towering ferns and
other plants&mdash;a form, with firm-set teeth
and flashing eye, transported by fury,
while his feet were rooted to the
spot&mdash;the face of Allan Graham, who saw and
overheard, yet failed to comprehend the
situation!
</p>

<p>
A vindictive desire to separate the lovers
if he could, and to humiliate the man he
hated, took possession of the diabolical
mind of Holcroft, who said,
</p>

<p>
'Let me kiss your hand, Olive, but once
again, ere I leave you&mdash;I, whom you loved
once so well!'
</p>

<p>
'Insolent!' exclaimed the girl, impetuously.
</p>

<p>
But, ere she could resist him or escape,
he threw his arms round her, pressed her
to his breast, kissed her many times, and
then&mdash;as Allan sprang forward&mdash;he quitted
the conservatory, and vanished into the
gloom outside, while, with a low wail of
horror and distress at the shameful affront
put upon her, Olive covered her face with
her tremulous hands, and murmured,
</p>

<p>
'Oh, this is too much to endure!'
</p>

<p>
'Too much, indeed,' said a voice, as a
heavy hand grasped her shoulder, and she
was swung round with a force that was
almost rude, to meet the white face and
flaming eyes of Allan.
</p>

<p>
'Allan,' she exclaimed, piteously, and
held out her hands.
</p>

<p>
'Stand off and touch me not,' he cried.
'Idiots only will be cozened twice,' he
added, unconsciously quoting Dryden.
</p>

<p>
He gave her an awful and withering
glance, and, snatching up a heavy stick, he
dashed into the garden after the intruder,
whom he saw in the act of escaping by a
gate that opened upon the common, across
which he fled like a hare, pursued closely
by Allan Graham, whom, as an active
mountaineer and trained soldier, he was not
likely to escape.
</p>

<p>
The sun had set amid dim and lurid
clouds; the evening was gloomy, close, and
stormy; the bellowing of the ocean could
be heard along the whole line of the
sea-wall, from the Spur Redoubt to Southsea
Castle.  A heavy gale from the offing was
rolling the waves in their force and fury
upon the shore, where, in anticipation
thereof, the boats and bathing machines
were all drawn up high and dry upon the
shelving shingle.  The shipping at anchor
were straining on their cables, and sheet
lightning, red and fiery, threw forward in
black outline from time to time the
undulating curves of the Isle of Wight.
</p>

<p>
But Allan Graham saw none of these
things; he only saw the fugitive Holcroft,
who ran madly towards the sea-shore, and
disappeared round the angle of the East
Battery that overhangs the sea, closely
followed by his infuriated pursuer.
</p>

<p>
'What has happened, Olive&mdash;speak?'
said Lady Aberfeldie, who was completely
bewildered by the condition in which she
found Olive, and bitterly regretting the
absence of her husband, who was then in
London; and Olive, feeling now the
unwisdom and futility of further
concealment, told her all about the power
Holcroft had wielded over her by working
on her pride, shame, and fear, and how,
by direct acting, he had too probably
achieved the very end which the evil
prompting of a moment had doubtless
suggested&mdash;the placing of herself in a
false position with Allan, and causing a
hopeless quarrel and separation between
them.
</p>

<p>
'And now that he has left me thus,
auntie, I shall never see him again!' cried
Olive, while, burying her face in her hands,
she wept bitterly.  'I shall never forget
how pallid his poor face became, and how
his eyes glared with fury through their
unshed tears; and never shall I forget the
gaze of tenderness, astonishment, and
reproach that came into them as he turned
from me in bitter silence.'
</p>

<p>
'It is very unfortunate,' said Lady
Aberfeldie, with difficulty restraining her own
tears, though buoyed up by indignation at
the daring and insolence of Holcroft; 'but
Allan will return in a few minutes, and I
shall undertake to explain the whole
affair.'
</p>

<p>
But the time passed on; hour succeeded
hour, till midnight struck, and aunt and
niece sat watching each other with pale
and anxious faces, for there was no
appearance of Allan.
</p>

<p>
They supposed that in his first gust of
anger he had gone to some club or hotel,
and would, when in a calmer frame of
mind, return on the morrow; but the
morrow had passed into evening, and he
returned no more!
</p>

<p>
Olive felt that he and she were roughly
rent asunder, and likely to drift further
and further apart on the stormy sea of life.
</p>

<p>
And now to account for his non-appearance.
</p>

<p>
Aware that he had no mercy to expect
between the hands of Allan on one side,
and those of the police on the other, Hawke
Holcroft thought only of escape, and,
dreading flight towards the town, in the
blindness of his terror or confusion he
turned towards the sea, and ran along the
summit of the steep, rocky, and abruptly
shelving bank that is overlooked by the
low earthen-works and square, squat
tower of Southsea Castle.
</p>

<p>
Finding Allan close upon him, so close
that he could almost hear his footsteps,
amid the bellowing of the wind and
booming of the sea that rolled in white foam
against the stone parapet wall which was
bordered by the narrow pathway he was
compelled to pursue, he suddenly turned
in blind desperation and levelled a revolver
at Allan's head, while a tiger-like fury
filled his sallow visage.
</p>

<p>
It snapped, hung fire, and was struck
from his hand by Allan, on which he turned
again and fled into the grey obscurity,
whither Allan could not follow him now,
as the sea with a succession of angry roars
was lashing the steep stony bank and
hurling its spray over the parapet wall,
while wave after wave boiled over all the
path the fugitive had to pursue.
</p>

<p>
Again and again he saw the miserable
wretch lose his footing, while the waves
tried to suck him down, and again and
again, clinging with despairing energy to
the edge of the stony path, he strove to
recover it.
</p>

<p>
A low wailing cry of despair escaped
him as one wave towering higher than all
the rest&mdash;perhaps a tenth wave, if there be
such a thing&mdash;enveloped him in its foamy
flood and sucked him furiously downward
in its back-wash, amid which he seemed to
struggle feebly as a fly might have done.
</p>

<p>
Once or twice Allan saw his head bobbing
amid the white foam and his upthrown
hands, that had nothing to clutch at, till
the waves dashed him again and again, as if
in wild sport, among a row of great wooden
dolphins which are placed in the shingle
there to break the fury of the incoming sea,
and stand up like a line of gigantic teeth,
and in less than a minute Hawke Holcroft
vanished from sight!
</p>

<p>
Then a long breath escaped Allan.
</p>

<p>
'The sea has done it not I, though
richly did he merit at my hands the fate he
has met,' thought he, as he hurried away
to alarm the sentinels and castle guard;
but all too late to succour Holcroft in any
way or even to search for his body.
</p>

<p>
Darkness had set in now, the fury of
the sea was increasing, and if Hawke
Holcroft was found at all, it would be as a
drowned man, with the fatal diamonds in
his possession, when the tide ebbed and the
long stretch of seaweed and shingle was
left dry.
</p>

<p>
But he might never be found at all,
and lie, as the skeletons are still lying
there, among the timbers of the <i>Royal
George</i>.
</p>

<p>
Allan knew that he was due with his
regiment at Woolwich on the morrow, and,
being full of rage and bitter disappointment
with disgust at the whole of this
recent event&mdash;too full to have explanations
with his mother, or hear aught that Olive
Raymond might, as he naturally thought,
be artful enough to advance, perhaps to
brazen out&mdash;intent only on quitting the
scene and, if possible, of forgetting a
situation so degrading and repugnant to his
pride&mdash;he resolved to write to his father
renouncing his cousin for ever; and,
throwing himself into a cab, drove straight to
the railway station and took the first train
to London.
</p>

<p>
Hence it was that he returned to Puddicombe
House no more.
</p>

<p>
And as the train swept clanking along
the line, amid the monotony of its sound
the words of Olive's song, with what he
deemed her accursed raillery underlying
them, came gallingly back to his memory,
with painful reiteration,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'I know a maiden fair to see,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take care!<br />
  She can both false and friendly be,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beware, beware!<br />
  Trust her not.  She is fooling thee.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'And for what a wretched creature she
has dared to fool me!' he thought, while
a bitter malediction hovered on his lips.
</p>

<p>
In due time, with all his comrades of
the Black Watch, he found himself on
board the <i>Nepaul</i>, and, after she had
steamed out of the Albert Dock, amid the
deafening cheers of thousands, even amid all
the bustle and high military enthusiasm
that surrounded him, he felt half mad with
grief, mortification, and fury.
</p>

<p>
Night and day his mind was full of
angry and bitter dreams; a conviction of
Olive's guilt and the shame of her discovery
were ever before him.
</p>

<p>
Brave young Allan Graham was stricken
to the heart; yet he bore himself graciously
and gallantly, though a conviction
grew strong in his mind that he would
find his grave in the land he was going
to.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
IN THE LAND OF THE PHARAOHS.
</h3>

<p>
Ismailia, by the Lake of Timsah, lay
steeped in sunshine, while the regiments
of the Highland Brigade, for the second
time, after the lapse of eighty years,
landed upon Egyptian soil again.
</p>

<p>
Built equi-distant from Port Said and
Suez, this new town protects the outlet of
the second canal, which carries the supply
of fresh water from the Nile near Cairo to
the Isthmus.  In 1862 the place where it
stands was a scene of sandy desolation.
Seven years later saw a brilliant little
French town in existence with a broad
quay, bordering the lake, with hotels, caf√©s,
a theatre where vaudevilles were acted, a
street of well-stocked shops, a public
garden with a fountain spouting Nile water
in the Place Champollion, the telegraph
wires overhead, and the bells of a Christian
church ringing, where, but a short time
before, the wandering Bedouin, the nomadic
dweller in tents, the child of the desert,
with glittering spear and floating burnous,
urged his camel on its solitary way from
Ramses to Serapium.
</p>

<p>
The heat was intense, and to the eyes
of the Scottish mountaineers the scenery
about Ismailia seemed intensely monotonous.
Cloudless skies of the deepest and
richest blue formed a contrast to the vast
expanse of yellow sand that stretched far,
far away till lost in hazy distance, but the
desert is susceptible of many shades and
changes of colour.
</p>

<p>
It is said that at Ismailia the stranger
can very fully realise the purity, the balm,
and beauty of the Egyptian night, especially
if seated over wine and a cigar in the
H√¥tel des Voyageurs, where he may watch
the Lake of Timsah, and so varied are the
tints of the latter in the light of the red sun
setting in the west, amid a lurid glow of
gold and crimson, that it looks like three
lakes; towards the canal that leads to
Serapium it seems a deep blue; where the
ships are grouped near Ismailia, its
wavelets seem silver with gold, while the moon
comes slowly up like a silver dawn, and
rosy tints yet linger when the sun has
gone abruptly down.
</p>

<p>
But no time was given to the Highlanders
either to study scenery or artistic
effects, even if so disposed.  Each
regiment was rapidly formed in column&mdash;every
officer and man in his fighting kit,
with tropical helmet, haversack, and water
bottle; the men with their valises and
greatcoats, and the march began towards
the desert where the Egyptians of Arabi
awaited them at Tel-el-Kebir.
</p>

<p>
Little was talked of then but the recent
cavalry fight at Kassassin, where our Life
Guards swept the ranks of Arabi's
infantry, and where a horde of wild
Bedouins, who had been hovering near the
field like birds of prey, after their
departure poured in to strip and rob the dead
and wounded of both armies, killing all
who were able to resist.
</p>

<p>
The mess&mdash;or regiment rather, as there
was no mess now&mdash;saw that Allan Graham
had come back a sorely changed man, who
had hours of evident depression alternated
by furious hilarity&mdash;not the man's old
style at all; but his world, like Hamlet's,
was 'out of joint.'  The conduct of Olive
Raymond yet remained a profound, an
unexplained and exasperating mystery to
him; but he felt, how bitterly, that love
lives even after trust and faith are dead
and buried; and now that he was so far,
far away from her, dreams of a yearning
and sorrowful kind, with many stinging
thoughts, that he feared would never leave
him, filled his mind as he marched at the
head of his company towards the darkening
desert.
</p>

<p>
In his looks and manner, Evan Cameron,
like others, read a marked yet undefinable
change; his bearing now was occasionally
haughty and reserved; at other times his
eyes seemed strangely sad.  What could
have happened?  Cameron did not ask,
and as yet Allan said nothing about it;
and, sooth to say, in his own thoughts of
Eveline, the former had cause to be sad
enough too.
</p>

<p>
His memories were ever of the days at
Dundargue, and the chance parting in the
belvidere at Maviswood; and again her
kisses, the touch of her little caressing
hands, with her voice came vividly to
him.
</p>

<p>
In some of the last papers that had
reached the transport, <i>vi√¢</i> the Continent,
he could see that she was leading a life of
outward gaiety.  Could he doubt that it
was otherwise than outward?  He
gathered a sombre satisfaction from the
thought, and then strove to set it aside
as selfish.
</p>

<p>
Why should she not enjoy balls and
flowers-shows, races and regattas, the
drawing-room at Buckingham Palace, and
other brilliant gatherings?  Yet as he
read of these things a frown of mingled
anger, sorrow, and even mockery gathered
on his brow in spite of himself.
</p>

<p>
In the same papers Allan could discover
no trace of any body having been cast upon
the beach either at Southsea or the shore of
the Isle of Wight, and hence he supposed
that the remains of the drowned Holcroft
must have been taken out to sea.
</p>

<p>
The Highland enthusiasm, the warlike
spirit that blazed up within him, kept him
from a great despair, for latterly his love
for Olive had become a part of his own
existence.
</p>

<p>
The novelty of the land in which our
new campaign had opened, the incessant
watchfulness, the time and attention each
duty brought with it, all gave him a
recklessness as to life and as to fear of
death, that after a time won him the
involuntary admiration of the Black Watch
and the whole Highland Brigade.
</p>

<p>
Just as the sun set, the bugles sounded
a 'halt' after a march of six miles, but six
terrible miles they were, for at every step
the Highlanders sank ankle-deep in the
soft and sun-dried sand.
</p>

<p>
All around that halting-place a sea of
the latter seemed to stretch in every
direction, bare and desolate, save where
Ismailia lay, its edifices looking inky,
black, and opaque in outline against the
orange and primrose sky; and black
looked the masts of the transports as they
rose like a forest amid the waters of the
Lake of Timsah.
</p>

<p>
When the first bivouac was formed at
El-Magfar, the bare-kneed Highlanders,
each rolled in his blanket on the soft
sand, slept comfortably enough; but with
morning came the first instalment of
misery, when the heavy dew that soaks
everything left them cold and stiff, and
longing even for the fierce unclouded sun
again.
</p>

<p>
'A devil of a country this,' said
Carslogie.  'By day it is too hot to eat, to
act, or even to think; and at night it is
too cold to sleep or think of anything but
the bitter cold itself.'
</p>

<p>
And but for the hot tea made for all
over-night, when the brigade first came
to its camping-place, some injury to health
must have ensued; but the men were too
weary to eat even a biscuit, of which each
carried a two days' supply in the canvas
haversack that formed his only pillow.
</p>

<p>
Before the sun was up, Allan rose from
the sand and looked about him.  Under
the starlight the Highland bivouac&mdash;for
camp it was not&mdash;presented a curious
sight, as the men lay in ranks, each rolled
in his blanket, beside the piles of arms;
the sentinels of the out-piquets on the way
to Tel-el-Mahuta standing dark and
motionless against the blue of the sky,
looking in kilt and helmet like the statues of
ancient Romans.
</p>

<p>
To get a little warmth ere the pipers
blew the 'rouse,' he walked a short
distance from where the men of his company
lay, and near a fragment of ruined wall,
beside which grew a patch of those prickly
plants (round which hillocks of sand
occasionally gather), and a solitary gum-tree
grew, he found, rolled up in a burnous,
and evidently concealing himself in dread
and fear, a Bedouin.  There was a small
palm-grove near Magfar; why did he not
seek hiding there?
</p>

<p>
'Hallo, my man,' thought Allan, 'what
are you lurking here for?&mdash;mischief, no
doubt.'
</p>

<p>
He drew his claymore, supposing the
lurker could be but a spy who had crept
within our chain of sentries; but the wild
son of the desert raised his hands
deprecatingly, and, opening his burnous, showed
that he was perishing from a dreadful
wound&mdash;a sword cut that had laid open
his right shoulder and breast.
</p>

<p>
Allan put his brandy-flask to the
sufferer's lips, raising his head as he did
so, and then addressed him inquiringly.
Allan had picked up some Arabic in India,
and thus could understand the Bedouin,
who informed him that he had been wounded
thus, by one of those sons of Anak, our
Life-guardsmen, in the charge at Kassassin.
</p>

<p>
'An Egyptian, by jingo!' exclaimed
Carslogie, who came up at that moment.
'Are you about to become a studier of
humanity?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, Cuvier was great in the study of
wasps, and so forth.  Why shouldn't I
study Egyptians?' replied Allan, grimly,
'and this poor devil seems to have been
wounded in the affair at Kassassin the
other day.'
</p>

<p>
'You understand him, then?'
</p>

<p>
'Perfectly.  Please bring one of the
staff surgeons quickly; he must have been
lying here when we took up our ground
over-night.'
</p>

<p>
The Bedouin, whose astonishment that
he was not butchered on the instant was
great, stared alternately at Allan and at
Carslogie, who was a young fellow of the
best style, one whose fine face even the
hideous tropical helmet (which is such an
appalling substitute for the graceful feather
bonnet) could not spoil.  His figure was
slight and elegant, his features clearly cut
and refined, and his bright brown chestnut
hair was close and curly.
</p>

<p>
The Bedouin was a perfect type of his
race, and, save that he had a good
Remington rifle slung over his back, was not
much changed in habit, nature, or turn of
thought from his ancestors of the tribe of
Ishmael.
</p>

<p>
Though weakened now by suffering and
great loss of blood, he seemed spare of
figure and light of limb, well-formed and
active, tall, but whether thirty or forty
years old it was impossible to say.  He
had a long, thin, and expressive countenance,
with glittering black eyes and teeth
of pearly whiteness.  His colour was a
dusky brown, his hair black and wiry.
</p>

<p>
He was evidently a Bedouin of the desert,
as the two ends of the scarlet shawl which
formed his turban hung down upon the
shoulder, to distinguish him from the Arabs
of other tribes.  He was clad in a thick
dark brown baracan of wool, which served
as a dress by day and a bed by night, over
which was a robe with wide sleeves.
</p>

<p>
When the doctor was dressing his wound,
which was certainly a terrible sword-cut,
his richly embroidered girdle was seen,
and this announced him to be a sheikh,
and such he was proved to be, as Allan
gathered from him that his name was
Zeid el Ourdeh, the sheikh of a tribe near Jebel
Dimeshk, between the desert and the
disused railway to Heliopolis, 'the City of
the Sun;' and as he lay there in his
picturesque costume, with a group of
wondering Highlanders, in their dark kilts and
white helmets, gathered round him, and
the blood-red sun in the distance, coming
swiftly up out of the dry sand of the yellow
desert, as it seemed, Allan thought what a
subject was the whole for the pencil of an
artist.
</p>

<p>
The Bedouin was on the point of fainting,
so great was the agony occasioned by
the dressing of his wound; but a mouthful
from Allan's flask revived him more
than it would have done one usually
accustomed to such stimulants.
</p>

<p>
'Some sick men are going back to the
rear at Ismailia,' said Allan.  'Carslogie,
please to order the ambulance people to
come this way.  I'll send this unfortunate
creature to the Third Field Hospital.'
</p>

<p>
Carslogie paused to scrape a vesta and
light a cigar, which he proceeded to puff
with a sigh of satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
'Quick, Carslogie,' cried Allan.  'We
have no time to lose.  The bugles will
sound immediately.'
</p>

<p>
And Carslogie went on his way with the
air of a man who thought the world would
be none the worse for having a Bedouin
the less in it.
</p>

<p>
In his own language, and in terms peculiarly
his own, Allan could make out that
the sheikh was thanking him in a low and
earnest voice, and adding that while life
lasted he 'would always deem him as a
brother.  You infidels are powerful as the
genii of old; you can flash a light at night
brilliant as that of the sun at noon; you
have another light that springs from the
unseen air.  I have seen it in the streets
of Cairo' (no doubt referring to gas); 'and
you can send your thoughts from land to
land under the sea more swiftly than even
the Afrite did in the days of Solomon;
and I fear that from your hands the Egyptians
will suffer such chastisement as fell
on the people of Noah, of Ad, and of Thamud,'
he added, wearily and sadly, as his
head fell on one side.
</p>

<p>
A party of the ambulance had now come,
and Allan informed him that he was to be
sent to Ismailia.  He did more; he placed
some money in his hand wherewith to procure
necessaries, and, while the eyes of the
Bedouin gleamed with gratitude, his brown
mahogany and attenuated fingers closed
avariciously and tightly on such an unusual
gift as coins.
</p>

<p>
''Pon my soul, Allan Graham,' said
Carslogie, 'considering how these rascals
treated our wounded at Kassassin, your
humanity, to say the least of it, seems to
me to be a little misplaced.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps; but I cannot help it.  I feel
a little tender-hearted just now,' said Allan,
with a smile, as the wounded Bedouin&mdash;of
whom he had not seen the last&mdash;was borne
away.
</p>

<p>
The pipes struck up, and once more the
columns began a ten-miles' march to
Mahsameh.  The Gordon Highlanders were in
advance, the Camerons next, then came
the Highland Light Infantry, and then the
Black Watch, all toiling through the soft,
deep sand.  These splendid regiments were
all marching in massed columns, at one pace
interval, the cavalry moving with them
collaterally on one flank, and the artillery
on the other, clattering along, with spunges,
buckets, spare wheels, and forge waggons&mdash;all
forming a grand, impressive spectacle
in the midst of the wide Egyptian desert.
</p>

<p>
To Scottish soldiers, who are usually
so well-grounded in their Bible history,
the soil they were treading, if the toil
made it disgusting on one hand, memory
made it full of deep interest on the other.
They knew that they were already in, or
were approaching, the Land of Goshen,
where, by the tasks they had conned at
school and those which their ministers
superintended, they were aware that they
were nigh unto the place where Jacob
dwelt of old, that he might be near to
Joseph, who lived at Pharaoh's court;
near to the place where father and son
met, and where we still find Rameses,
which was built by the Israelites in the
days of their bondage; and, as our soldiers
marched on, some there were who recalled
these things to each other, as their
minds went back to the village kirk, whose
bells awoke the echoes of green and lonely
glens, and to the firesides of their fathers,
when expounding on these things on
Saturday night, when the 'big ha' Bible'
was produced; and, though they might
yawn wearily over such matters at home,
these scriptural names and localities had
a very different effect upon them now.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap20"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
THE MARCH THROUGH GOSHEN.
</h3>

<p>
On, and on, and on, through the same
kind of Egyptian landscape&mdash;tame, barren,
and insipid&mdash;so terribly vapid and flatly
horrid, when compared with the Salvatoresque
hills and glens of their native
land&mdash;the naked plain, bounded by
occasional hillocks at vast distances&mdash;the
toilsome march of the Highlanders continued.
Yet there are luxuriant plains in some
parts of the Land of Goshen.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes date-trees were seen, with
trunks bare and slender, or mud-walled
wigwams on the causeways; but it is a
land that, with all its vast antiquity and
religious associations, of which no poet
has ever sung.  'What, indeed, could an
Egyptian sing on the reed of Gesner or
Theocritus?' asks Volney.  'He sees
neither limpid streams, nor verdant lawns,
nor solitary caves; and is equally a
stranger to valleys, mountain-sides, and
impending rocks.'  Miss Martineau is
almost the only traveller who claims for
Egypt the attributes of the picturesque
and varied in beauty!
</p>

<p>
And there were incessant swarms of
scorpions, gnats, and more especially of
flies&mdash;one of the many plagues of
Egypt&mdash;which were so numerous that it was
impossible to eat the dry ration biscuits
without the chance of swallowing these
pests also.
</p>

<p>
More than once, on the summit of a
sandy hillock, there would appear, sharply
defined against the clear blue sky, the
picturesque figure of a mounted Bedouin,
with his white burnous floating about him,
a tall, reed-like spear, or a long musket
slung by his side&mdash;a man unchanged in
aspect or ideas from his nomadic
forefathers, who saw the mailed Crusaders
toiling on their way to Jerusalem&mdash;gazing
with stolid wonder at the marching
columns in a costume so strange, with
bare knees, white sporrans, and kilts of
dark-green tartan waving at every step;
while on the hot and breathless air there
was borne towards him the hoarse and
shrill music of the pipes&mdash;the same wild
music that, eighty years before, woke the
echoes of the Pyramids and of the streets
of Grand Cairo.
</p>

<p>
But what land in the world has not
echoed to their music?
</p>

<p>
All our soldiers were more or less full
of enthusiasm&mdash;anxious to get at Arabi&mdash;to
grapple with the enemy, 'and get
the business over,' as they phrased it;
though it is doubtful if they quite believed
in Sir Garnet Wolseley's apparently boastful
prediction that the war would be
ended by the 16th of that month, September.
</p>

<p>
In the exuberance of their spirits, many
chorussed merrily when the pipes ceased,
which was seldom, lilting as, a writer says,
only 'the song-loving Scots' can do, as
in the days when their country was
redolent of song, when the milk-maid sang
some old chant to her cows in field or
byre, when the house-wife span at her
ingle-neuk, when the reapers filled the
harvest-field with melody, and the
ploughman in winter when he turned the
glistening furrows over the lea.
</p>

<p>
And now and anon the Bedouin scouts
would wheel their horses round and vanish
ere our cavalry could reach them to bear
to Tel-el-Kebir the terrible tidings, as
some said, 'that devils in petticoats' were
coming, and, as others asserted, 'devils
with beards down to their knees.'
</p>

<p>
Every man had one hundred rounds of
ball-cartridge and his bottle filled with
water from the Canal, called by the
soldiers jocularly 'Egyptian soup,' from its
hue and quality; thus a ration of rum,
when it was served out, proved very
acceptable, though some there were who
did not much affect the cold tea, and Allan
could not help smiling at a little argument
that ensued between Corporal MacSnish
of his company and one of the Scripture-readers,
who, to their honour, be it said,
kept up with the troops, went under fire
with them, and after the conflict did all in
their power to alleviate the sufferings of
the wounded.
</p>

<p>
'Don't grumble, corporal,' said the
Scripture-reader, 'though I know it is a
soldier's privilege.  He who paints the
lilies of the field and feeds the sparrow
will supply all you want.'
</p>

<p>
'Oich, I hope so, whateffer; but a
corporal of the Black Watch is worth a good
many sparrows, I can tell you, and as for
the cold tea&mdash;ugh!'
</p>

<p>
'Better for you than all the liquor in
the world, my man,' said the Scripture-reader.
</p>

<p>
'Even the worst whusky, whateffer,
would be better to my mind; and we have
Scripture for it that we should not drink
water alone.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!' said the reader, doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' urged the corporal, who knew his
Bible well; 'are we not told in Maccabees,
chapter xv. and verse 39, that "it is
hurtful to drink wine or water alone, as wine
mingled with water is pleasant and
delighteth the taste?"'
</p>

<p>
'For all that,' replied the Scripture-reader,
'I agree with Sir Garnet that
water is alone the drink for man.'
</p>

<p>
'Yet the only man that Holy Writ
records as ever asking for it, didn't get it.'
</p>

<p>
'Who was <i>he</i>?'
</p>

<p>
'Dives, and we all know where <i>he</i> was
then.  Scripture again!' said the corporal,
with a smirk on his sharp Highland face,
and thinking he had decidedly the best of
the argument.
</p>

<p>
During a mid-day halt on this march,
some of the troops constructed out of
blankets and rifles with fixed bayonets
erections like gipsy tents, to shelter them
from the blazing heat of the sun, and a
singular kind of encampment they presented.
</p>

<p>
With ship biscuits and tinned meat and
some brandy to flavour their cold tea,
Allan Graham, Cameron, Carslogie, and
some other officers of the corps made
themselves as comfortable as they could
under shelter of their impromptu tents,
and many were even jolly, especially
Carslogie, who was rather a noisy and
irrepressible fellow.
</p>

<p>
Stretched on the sand with his tropical
helmet tilted back on his head, he drank
his 'cold tea,' as he called it, though it
was stiff half-and-half grog, and proffered
his cigar-case to all.
</p>

<p>
'Isn't this jolly!' he exclaimed.  'Instead
of this, we might have been out in
the blazing open.'
</p>

<p>
Then he struck up a verse of a song to
the air of the 'Garb of Old Gaul,' and
composed by an anonymous writer, though
he hinted it was Mr. John Bright:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They talk of a good time, when warfare shall cease,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the nations hobnob o'er a big pipe of peace,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lion and the lamb in auriferous mead<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On bills of exchange in beatitude feed.<br />
  But keep your powder dry, my boys, and keep your bayonets keen;<br />
  The world can't do without us yet, nor will it soon, I ween!<br />
  Then stern and true, where work's to do, we'll do it as we can,<br />
  And shoulder to shoulder still march in the van!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'The good time predicted seems a long
way off yet,' he added, with a sigh, to find
that the last of his grog was gone, for
after a hot morning's march it was, as he
said, 'quite a Sybaritish luxury.'  'Well,
well, a little time will find us face to face
with Arabi, and we shall exchange the
fleshpots of Egypt for those of the old
country.'
</p>

<p>
This was the 11th of September, and
the march was resumed at five in the
evening for the head-quarters at Kassassin,
where the column found its tents pitched.
Allan shared his with Cameron, and, like
their comrades, they proceeded to make
themselves as comfortable as they could;
but it soon became known that on the
morrow the Highland Brigade was to lead
in the night attack upon the formidable
entrenchments of Arabi Pasha at Tel-el-Kebir.
</p>

<p>
'The last bugle some of us may ever
hear will sound at six to-morrow evening,'
said Allan, as he and Cameron, after a
picnic kind of repast, lay on the floor of
the tent and smoked their Havanas, with
their jackets open, and minus collars and
ties, for the evening was hot then, though
cold and dew came together the moment
the sun went down, and then there was no
light in the tent save those of the stars.
</p>

<p>
'Listen to Carslogie singing in his
tent; no sombre reflections seem to come
to him,' said Cameron.
</p>

<p>
'Some of us, of course, will lose the
number of our mess, as the sailors say,'
said Allan again, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
'Well, it is not a cheerful thought,
Allan,' said Cameron; 'but life is not
particularly rosy with me just now, so I am
just the fellow to have a charmed one when
under fire again to-morrow.'
</p>

<p>
'There is a history in all men's lives,
Cameron, it is said.  Well, there is a devil
of a lot in mine&mdash;more than I care for.'
</p>

<p>
'You have long seemed rather low in
spirit.'
</p>

<p>
'I have reason,' replied Allan, while
that inexpressible longing to talk of
himself and his sorrows, which seizes upon
men now and then, came upon him, and he
related to Cameron the whole story of his
engagement with his cousin, his doubts
and fears&mdash;the intrusions and outrageous
insults put upon them both by Hawke
Holcroft, who seemed to wield some
degrading and mysterious power once&mdash;a
power that was ended now; 'and,' he added,
after his narrative was ended, 'I trust
under heaven never to look upon her false
fair face again!'
</p>

<p>
Cameron heard his strange story in silent
amazement.
</p>

<p>
'Can all this not be explained?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'I want no explanation; I have been
degraded enough,' replied Allan, bitterly.
</p>

<p>
Cameron, strangely enough, had never,
as yet, even to his early friend and
comrade, made any reference to what the
latter fully knew&mdash;his love for Eveline: and
never once had her name escaped him
during the long voyage in the Nepaul
from Woolwich to Ismailia, nor even on
the march towards the enemy.
</p>

<p>
Poor Cameron had thought, what was
the use of speaking of that matter now,
when all was hopeless&mdash;all over, and for
ever, between them?  But now, encouraged
or melted by Allan Graham's new
confidence in himself, he said,
</p>

<p>
'With reference to the risks we run
tomorrow, I am glad that I set my house in
order, did so, indeed, before we marched
from Edinburgh.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'About Stratherroch, or what remains
of it.'
</p>

<p>
'In what way, Evan?'
</p>

<p>
We must all die sooner or later&mdash;a
soldier sooner, perhaps, than a civilian; so
by will, if aught happens to me&mdash;I have
left the old place&mdash;tower and hill, wood,
glen, and water, to&mdash;to Eveline&mdash;I mean
to Lady Paget.'
</p>

<p>
'Good heavens!  To Eveline!' exclaimed
Allan, his face full of a surprise that
was unseen in the starlight and darkened
bell tent.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Have you no one else?'
</p>

<p>
'None save my brother Duncan, who has
himself a large fortune&mdash;none whom I love
as&mdash;as I love her,' added Cameron, in a
very broken voice.
</p>

<p>
'Poor Evan!  I always suspected&mdash;indeed,
knew of it.'
</p>

<p>
'You did?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Evan.'
</p>

<p>
'And&mdash;and your sister.'
</p>

<p>
'She loved you.'
</p>

<p>
'My God!&mdash;yet was sacrificed to another.'
</p>

<p>
They wrung each other's hands in the
dark, and both remained silent for a time,
each full of his own thoughts, and in the
gloom seeing nothing but the end of
the other's cigar.
</p>

<p>
'Sir Paget is so rich that he will think
little of Stratherroch, even when cleared
of its heavy encumbrances,' said Evan.
</p>

<p>
'But he may think rather wrathfully of
the donor, though I trust and hope he may
never get it.  And now, good-night, Evan.
I have to parade the inlying picquet.  Get
some sleep if you can, old fellow&mdash;we'll
need all our metal on the morrow.'
</p>

<p>
And Allan, taking his dirk and claymore,
hurried away full of thought, for, if
his friend really fell, this odd bequest of
Stratherroch might compromise his sister
with her elderly spouse, and it was
impossible to make any change, circumstanced
as they were then.
</p>

<p>
'It is said that "every man has a history,
and that every man outlives it,"'
thought Allan; 'I wonder how it will be
with poor Evan and me.  And now to
parade the picquet, with that paragon of
sergeant-majors, M'Neill.  Picquets
parade at sunset&mdash;here, however, the sun
sets before we have time to think of it.
But the fight to-morrow will be to Evan
and me&mdash;for a time, at least&mdash;what opium
was to De Quincey and the author of the
"Ancient Mariner."  Fool, fool, fool that
I am, to think of <i>her</i> here at all!'
</p>

<p>
He left Evan Cameron inspired by a
mingled emotion of gratitude and satisfaction,
for Evan now knew and felt certain
that, had Eveline been in Allan's gift,
she might have been his bride ere this; and
with this conviction in his mind he strove to
court sleep, while roused ever and anon, as
in India, by the wild cry of the jackal.
</p>

<p>
Sir Garnet Wolseley had now come up,
the brigade of guards also, and the whole
strength of the British force was
concentrated at Kassassin, the place of our
cavalry victory, where our horse so gallantly
charged and swept, sword in hand,
through the brigades of Egyptian guns in
the dark.
</p>

<p>
With the next day's dawn those officers,
who, like the Master of Aberfeldie,
Cameron, and others, advanced beyond a palm
wood that grew near the camp, could
distinctly see with their field-glasses, against
the bright orange tint shed on the sky by
the up-coming sun, the strong earthworks
of Tel-el-Kebir crowning the hillocks, and
manned by more than twenty thousand
regular troops&mdash;the flower of the army of
Arabi, who commanded them in person;
and when the sun rose higher the infantry
could be seen lining the trenches, with all
their serried bayonets flashing in the
sunshine.
</p>

<p>
Beyond these formidable earthworks the
Egyptian camp could be seen in the
distance spreading far away an almost
unbroken line of tents, which, if they had all
occupants, betokened the presence of a very
great force indeed, as more than one
reconnoitring officer remarked to another.
</p>

<p>
Many were full of disappointment lest
there might be no fighting after all, as the
preceding morning the sound of heavy
firing had been heard in the rear of the
Egyptian position, and there seemed a
prospect of internal dissension facilitating
a dissolution of the whole enemy's
force.
</p>

<p>
Others more wisely suggested that Arabi
was only practising his artillery to
obtain the range in case his position was
turned and attacked in the rear, though
some asserted that the deep booming of
the guns was too steady and continuous
for mere practice of that nature.
</p>

<p>
The British troops had only a five days'
reserve of provisions, but it was generally
known that the country was rich and full
of subsistence beyond the lines of
Tel-el-Kebir, and that we would carry these no
man under Wolseley doubted.  Moreover,
he had with him sixty of the finest pieces
of cannon in the world.
</p>

<p>
The day passed on, and evening drew
nigh, the eventful day of the 12th
September, when every man was prepared to
'do or die!'  Higher and higher beat
every heart.  At six p.m. the 'fall in' was
sounded far along the lines, and quietly,
as if upon parade at home, that stately
soldier M'Neill, sergeant-major of the
Black Watch, paraded and posted the
markers for the various companies of his
corps, 'dressing' them with his usual accuracy.
</p>

<p>
The orders were brief but emphatic.
Perfect silence was to be maintained for
the march, and, as the place was to be
carried in grand old British style at the
point of the bayonet, on no account was an
order to load to be issued.
</p>

<p>
Each man carried a hundred rounds of
ball with one day's provisions, and his tin
water-bottle filled with cold tea.  The
tents were struck, and the baggage piled
for conveyance to the rear, in case of a
reverse, which no man thought possible.
</p>

<p>
The blood-red sun went swiftly down
westward of the point of attack beyond
Zagazig, darkness fell as swiftly over the
desert and the triple lines of canal that
flow between both Mahsameh and Abassa,
and then our army, fourteen thousand
strong, including foot, horse, and artillery,
began in silence the midnight march for
Tel-el-Kebir, the last march as it proved to
many a brave young fellow.
</p>

<p>
As the regiment moved off, Allan
thought of Evan Cameron's communication
over-night, and an irrepressible regret and
anxiety took possession of him, as he had
an unaccountable presentiment that his
friend was doomed to fall in the coming
strife.  Of himself he never thought at all.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
